He put up more monster numbers as a sophomore before playing for Team USA again, setting the stage for him to be among the top players considered for the top of the first round. As a right-handed first baseman who can really hit and who wasn't drafted out of high school, Torkelson draws invariable comparisons to Andrew Vaughn, the Cal standout who was the No. 3 pick in the 2019 Draft. He controls at-bats extremely well and draws a ton of walks. He's able to drive the ball from foul pole to foul pole and he uses the middle of the field when he's at his best. He's able to hit the ball out to all fields, with tremendous loft power to his pull side. He doesn't sell out for that power, but gets to it with ease. Defensively, he's worked hard to improve at first and is very comfortable there. He's taken some groundballs at third and played some left field, where he's adequate. But it will really be his bat that has him in conversations about the first few picks in June.</span>

His 14 homers in 2018 broke the school freshman record of 13 set by eventual first-rounder Zack Cox in 2009, and Kjerstad encored with 17 as a sophomore. He offers the best left-handed power in the 2020 college class and only potential No. 1 overall pick Spencer Torkelson has more pop among collegians. Kjerstad's strength and bat speed give him well above-average raw power to all fields. He has a complicated swing that features a big hand circle in his load, so he has to be precise with his timing to make it work -- but he has done so in college and was the top performer in the U.S. collegiate team's lineup last summer. He's an aggressive hitter who always will accumulate strikeouts as a tradeoff for his pop. Though Kjerstad records below-average running times out of the batter's box, he displays average speed once he gets going. He's not a threat on the bases but plays a capable right field. His huge power and solid arm strength fit the profile for the position.</span>

High but lacked physicality, so he lasted 34 rounds before the Twins took him in the 2017 Draft. He has continued to perform well at Minnesota, tying the school record with 16 saves as a freshman and leading the U.S. collegiate national team with seven that summer. Desperate for starters, the Gophers shifted him to the rotation a month into his sophomore year and he responded with a 2.11 ERA (second in the Big Ten Conference) before tying for the Team USA lead with a 0.69 mark. Meyer owns the best slider in the 2020 Draft, a wipeout 87-91 mph offering with which he can add and subtract depth. His four-seam fastball is a weapon as well, parking at 93-97 mph this spring, hitting 98 in the ninth inning of one start and maxing out at 100. His fading changeup showed flashes of becoming a solid pitch as he used it more often as a junior. There are questions as to whether Meyer can start at the highest level, mainly coming because he's a lean 6-footer. But he's also a quality athlete who repeats a fluid delivery and fills the strike zone, and he was so dominant in the brief 2020 season, so he has plenty of believers. A dogged competitor who also got regular at-bats in the Minnesota lineup, he's expected to go in the first 10 picks, which would push him past Glen Perkins (No. 22 overall in 2004) as the Gophers' highest-drafted pitcher ever.</span>

He has improved as hoped and will command a much higher bonus in the 2020 Draft, where he could surpass Jeff Granger (fifth overall, 1993) as the highest selection in Aggies history. After ranking third in NCAA Division I in opponent average (.162) and eighth in strikeouts per nine innings (13.2) as a sophomore, he pitched well with the U.S. collegiate national team in the summer. Lacy has boosted his fastball from 87-91 mph in high school to 92-97 these days, using his 6-foot-4 frame to create downhill plane, and hitters just don't seem to get good swings against it. He employs two distinct breaking balls, a downer curveball and a harder slider in the low 80s, with the slider surpassing his curve this spring and becoming a plus pitch. His changeup fades and sinks and grades as a well above-average pitch at its best, and it should become more consistently plus as he uses it more often. Lacy's biggest need is to improve his command and control. There's some effort in his three-quarters delivery and he's still learning to harness his overpowering stuff, so he can't always locate his pitches where he wants. Even without precise placement, he's a left-hander who can get swings and misses with four different offerings.</span>

A 37th-round pick by the Indians as a Florida high schooler in 2017, he could have gone in the top five rounds if signability weren't a factor. He started games at six different positions as a freshman and opened last year at second base before settling in at third base, leading NCAA Division I in runs (87) and the Southeastern Conference in hitting (.392) and on-base percentage (.486). The best pure hitter in the 2020 Draft, Martin has tremendous feel for the barrel and makes consistent hard contact with a short, quick right-handed stroke. He's not overly physical and may not have more than average raw power, but his hitting ability allows him to tap into every bit of it. He controls the strike zone extremely well and uses the entire field, exhibiting no weaknesses at the plate. Martin possesses solid speed and the instincts to play faster than that on the bases. A twitchy athlete, he has the quick feet, soft hands and enough arm to handle almost any position, though there are some concerns about his throwing. Scouts were hoping to see him at shortstop in 2020, but he instead opened the season at third base before moving to center field (where he could be a solid defender), and there's some thought he could wind up at second base.</span>

Hall) but priced himself almost entirely out of the Draft because he wanted to attend Georgia. He was college baseball's best pitcher for the first half of the 2019 season, surrendering a total of eight runs in 10 starts before missing two weeks with a lat issue and not dominating as much once he returned. Though he wasn't at his sharpest during the brief 2020 season, he's still on course to become the highest Draft pick in Bulldogs history, surpassing Jeff Pyburn (fifth overall, 1980). Hancock shares a lot in common with Casey Mize, whom Detroit took with the top pick in 2018. They're both Southeastern Conference right-handers with similar builds who pound the strike zone with a deep repertoire and missed some time during their sophomore seasons. His best offering is a fastball that sits at 94-97 mph and peaks at 99 with riding life, and all three of his secondary pitches grade as at least plus at their best. His go-to breaking ball is a mid-80s slider with which he manipulates the break exceptionally well, and Hancock also has a hard curveball that he relied on more in high school. He hasn't had to use his changeup much but he fades and locates it well, earning some plus-plus grades at times. A quality athlete with good body control, he commands his entire arsenal and should be a frontline starter if he stays healthy.</span>

He hit around .600 during his senior year of high school, but it wasn't against great competition in the Tucson, Arizona area high school ranks, and scouts wanted to see him in college. He put up good numbers as a freshman and video game numbers as a sophomore, but it was at the hitting haven that is New Mexico State. But when Gonzales went out and won Cape Cod League MVP honors this past summer by hitting .351/.451/.630, he all but put an end to the caveats. The 5-foot-10 middle infielder has as much pure hitting ability as just about any bat in the 2020 class. He does it with a short and compact swing and a ton of bat speed, controlling the bat head extremely well through the strike zone. There's strength in his compact frame, but he might be more of a doubles hitter even though he did homer seven times on the Cape in 154 at-bats with wood. Gonzales has decent speed and is a solid baserunner, and while he played shortstop this spring, evaluators don't think he has the arm or range to play shortstop. That does limit him to second base, but he's at least average there defensively. Gonzales fits the profile well as an offensive-minded second baseman, reminding some of the Brewers' Keston Hiura, who went in the top 10 of the 2017 Draft. There are less questions about Gonzales' defense and he might be more athletic, so it wouldn't be surprising to see him go in the same neck of the woods in the 2020 first round.</span>

He struggled at times in between, particularly when he got too focused on trying to hit for power. There's some split opinion as to the quality of his tools beyond his bat, but he should be one of the first prep position players taken and the first from Tennessee selected in the first round since Mike White in 1986. The best pure hitter in the 2020 prep class, Hassell has a pretty left-handed stroke and the hand-eye coordination to barrel balls with ease. He's at his best when he lashes line drives to all fields but his swing got too uphill when he made a conscious effort to hit homers in the middle of the summer. There's some debate as to how much pop he'll ultimately have, with some scouts envisioning solid raw power and believing he'll tap into most of it, while other evaluators think he's more lean than projectable and more of a 15-homer guy. Similarly, Hassell's biggest boosters believe he could have solid or better tools across the board with a chance to stick in center field and other scouts think his bat and arm are his only above-average attributes and he'll have to play a corner. Clocked up to 93 mph on the mound, he definitely has enough arm to play right field. The Vanderbilt recruit is a legitimate prospect as a pitcher as well but has a much higher ceiling as a hitter.</span>

While he was the 2018 PG WWBA Underclass World Championship MVP a year ago, it really wasn't until he was arguably the most consistent performer on this past summer's showcase circuit that he jumped up Draft boards. With a hot start to his spring, he kept soaring up lists to be considered the top high school bat in the class. Veen has the kind of left-handed swing that scouts can dream on, all coming from a projectable 6-foot-4 frame that can definitely add strength. He's more hit over power in games with excellent bat speed, especially because he utilizes a spread out stance, but he'll show off big-time power in batting practice when he stands more upright and creates leverage, showing the ability to loft the ball consistently. He's reminded some of Cody Bellinger offensively and has drawn some Kyle Tucker comps as well, though he's not quite as athletic. A solid average runner underway, Veen plays center field now, but is probably better suited for a corner spot. The Florida recruit is athletic enough with enough arm to profile in right, where his power potential could be a fit as well. If he continues to swing the bat like he did over the summer, he could very well figure into first-round conversations. His step forward at the start of the 2020 season, picking up from where he left off over the summer, has him very much in conversations among teams picking in the top 10.</span>

Three years later, he should go in the top 10 picks as the most polished left-hander available. He set Cardinals records for wins (13, first in NCAA Division I) and strikeouts (167, second in D-I) while leading Louisville to the College World Series as a sophomore in 2019, served as the U.S. collegiate national team's best starter during the summer, then ranked second in D-I in whiffs (48) and whiff rate (19.6 per nine innings) during the shortened 2020 season. Detmers is similar to former Cardinals star Brendan McKay, with an almost identical build and slightly less stuff. His fastball usually ranges from 90-94 mph but plays better than its average velocity because hitters don't seem to see it and he commands it so well. His 72-76 mph curveball has good shape and can be a plus pitch at its best, while his sinking changeup is effective as well. Detmers has a strong, durable frame that helps him repeat his delivery with ease, allowing him to pound the strike zone. His ability to locate his pitches permits him to succeed even when his fastball dips into the upper 80s. He has some of the best pitchability and mound presence in the 2020 Draft, traits that should help him become a mid-rotation starter.</span>

He bounced between Tennessee's rotation and bullpen in his first two college seasons, earning the Volunteers' first NCAA tournament victory since 2005 last June -- just two weeks after a line drive fractured and dislocated his jaw. He was sensational in fall practice, vaulting him into top-10-pick consideration, but missed three weeks as a precaution with soreness in his shoulder and made just one appearance during the truncated 2020 season. After working with a 91-95 mph fastball and topping out at 97 during the spring, Crochet dealt at 96-100 for most of the fall, and his heater already played better than its velocity because it has high spin rates. His 82-85 mph slider features above-average spin rates as well and his long arms create difficult angle on his breaking ball. He flashes a well above-average changeup at times, throwing it around 90 mph with deceptive arm speed. For a 6-foot-6 pitcher, Crochet does a nice job of keeping his long levers in sync and providing strikes. Scouts like his delivery and arm action, though he still needs to refine his command to make the most of his overpowering stuff. His short track record with his improved arsenal is a concern, but he still could surpass R.A. Dickey (18th overall, 1996) as the highest-drafted Volunteers pitcher ever.</span>

See him on another, and that scout might walk away worrying about the prep outfielder's swing. He stood out at the start of Major League Baseball's PDP League and was the only hitter to homer more than once, but he struggled down the stretch there and with Team USA in international competition. There is no question about Hendrick's raw power and he's tapped into it at times on big stages over the past two summers. He has incredibly quick hands and bat speed, along with leverage and loft, to generate that pop from the left side of the plate, but he tinkered with his setup this past summer and there was some concern with the uptick in swing and miss to his game. A very good athlete, Hendrick runs well enough to play center field, but he might profile best in right field, and has the arm strength to fit there as well. While there might be some risk in terms of strikeouts with Hendrick, there isn't a high school hitter in the country with more upside. The Mississippi State recruit has the chance to be a middle-of-the-lineup run producer with tons of power and plenty of scouts still believe in him reaching that ceiling.</span>

He was named Atlantic Coast Conference freshman of the year in 2018 after setting a North Carolina State first-year record with 13 homers. A veteran of the U.S. national 18-and-under and collegiate teams, he's the frontrunner to become the first catcher selected in the Draft. Bailey is a switch-hitter whose strength gives him solid raw power from both sides of the plate. His pop stands out more than his hitting ability, though he makes consistent contact and draws a healthy amount of walks. While he wasn't productive with wood bats last summer with Team USA, scouts believe he'll produce enough offense to profile as a regular. Even if he doesn't hit, Bailey provides enough defense to at least serve as a backup. He's more athletic and moves better than most catchers. He has solid if somewhat inconsistent receiving skills and has the arm strength to keep the running game in check.</span>

He and Jordan Westburg form the best double-play combination in college baseball, with scouts fairly split about who is the better prospect. Foscue has a higher floor while Westburg has the high ceiling, and both project to go in the top two rounds of the 2020 Draft. The U.S. collegiate national team's starter at second base last summer, Foscue plays a game that is somewhat reminiscent of Jeff Kent's. He provides more offense than most at his position, using strength, bat speed and a pull-heavy approach to generate plenty of power from the right side of the plate. Though he has an aggressive mentality, he has no difficulties making regular contact and projects as a 20-homer threat without excessive strikeouts. Foscue records below-average run times out of the batter's box but shows closer to average speed once he gets going. His arm and range are ordinary at second base, though he has good hands and instincts and turns the double-play pivot well. He might be able to handle third base at the next level but shortstop would be a stretch, limiting his potential utility value.</span>

Abel, who helped pitch his Jesuit High School to a state title, was named the state's Gatorade Player of the Year and then pitched well at a variety of summer showcase stops, should be the first Oregon prepster to go in the first round since Matt Smith back in 1994. The 6-foot-5 right-hander shows flashes of three plus pitches, starting with a fastball that was regularly in the 93-95 mph range this summer, though he tired a bit near the end of his run. He throws it downhill with good life at the bottom of the zone and then can come back with a four-seamer up in the zone with riding action. His 82-86 mph slider is a very effective pitch, and he also has feel for a curveball with more over the top rotation to it. The two morph into each other at times, but there's enough differentiation to believe he could throw both in the future, along with a future plus changeup that he sells with good arm speed and features sink and dip at the end. The Oregon State recruit generally throws strikes and he gets as high marks for his maturity and makeup as he does his stuff. He's only going to get stronger and throw harder as he physically matures, something he showed a glimpse of in one outing this spring before things got shut down, giving him the chance to be the first prep arm to come off the board in June.</span>

He may not have the lofty ceiling of Bobby Witt Jr. or C.J. Abrams, prep shortstops who went in the first six picks of the 2019 Draft, but he's a steady player who could have solid tools across the board. He's set to become the first Illinois high school position player to go in the first round since Jayson Werth in 1997. Using a simple right-handed swing and a calm approach, Howard makes repeated hard contact. He has impressive bat speed and a projectable 6-foot-2 frame that continues to add strength, so he could develop average or better power. He has solid speed and uses it well on the bases. A smooth defender at shortstop, Howard definitely will be able to remain at the position. He can make all the plays with athletic actions, quick hands and a strong arm capable of making throws from a variety of angles. The Oklahoma recruit has a high baseball IQ and a knack for slowing the game down on both sides of the ball.</span>

Yorke isn't projected to go as early as Haniger did after his college career (No. 38 overall), but it's a strong possibility his bat gets him off the board way earlier than either Vail (17th round of June 1970 Draft) or Haniger (31st round, 2009). Scouts believe Yorke has a real chance to swing the bat, with perhaps even plus hit potential from the right side of the plate. He's a natural hitter with a pure swing and an advanced approach at the plate and there's enough power potential in there to believe he could eventually be a run-producing type of player.  The questions about Yorke pop up concerning his future defensive home. He's played shortstop in high school, and might have the range, hands and instincts to stay there, but he had shoulder surgery and has anchors in his shoulder causing him to DH for all of his junior year in 2019. He was back on the dirt this spring, but what had been solid average arm strength had not yet returned. Still, he could profile very well as an offensive-minded second baseman with a bat that could be worth luring away from his commitment to the University of Arizona.</span>

He wasn't and turned down the Yankees as a 37th-rounder, then opened eyes with a much stronger body and stuff in the fall. Scouts wanted to see if he could maintain them over a full college season and never got the chance to find out, but he did throw one perfect game and flirt with another in his four starts -- which may be enough for him to join Marcus Stroman as the only first-round picks ever out of Duke. After working with an 88-93 mph fastball at the beginning of 2019 and dipping to 86-91 by season's end, Jarvis added 20 pounds to his 6-foot-2 frame and operated at 92-96 with effective downhill plane last fall and this spring. His breaking ball used to be average at best, and now he flashes a plus curveball in the upper 70s that he can manipulate into a distinct and equally effective slider in the mid-80s. His fading changeup remains his best secondary offering, grading as well above average at its best. Jarvis has improved his control along with his stuff, posting a 40-2 K-BB ratio in 27 innings while showing the ability to move his pitches around the strike zone. He repeats his delivery well and long has drawn praise for his competitiveness. Though he's already 22, has a narrow frame and lacks a long track record of displaying first-round stuff, he couldn't have been much more spectacular this spring.</span>

He really jumped on the national map when he starred as an underclassman on USA Baseball's 18 and Under team that won a gold medal in the Pan-American Championships. A combination of being under the microscope for so long and a more uneven summer has led Crow-Armstrong's star to fade a bit, though a big push at the start of the spring moved him back up Draft boards. Crow-Armstrong stood out early on in his high school career because of his ability to hit and run. Some swing and miss over this summer had some evaluators concerned, but he does have a track record of making a lot of loud contact. While he's clearly hit over power, he's stronger than some people think and there should be pop in the future, with some of that strength and power showing up before things were shut down. A plus runner, he can really play center and might be the best defensive outfielder in the class. A dynamic athlete who goes hard at all times, he reminds some of a Grady Sizemore type in terms of his frame. He's committed to Vanderbilt and was moving back up closer to the top of the first round with a return to who he'd been, along with some added strength, at the beginning of his senior year.</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Mitchell was a solid high school prospect at Orange Lutheran in California, one who was firmly in the middle of the Draft Top 100 in 2017. As toolsy as they come, concerns about his ability to tap into those tools consistently and his commitment to UCLA led to him not being selected until the 14th round (by the A's). He started to make good on his potential during a strong sophomore season with the Bruins, though he didn't get a chance to show what he could do with Team USA after a leg injury forced him off the Collegiate National Team. He wasn't fully cleared last fall, but he still impressed scouts with his batting practice sessions, and he had all tools on display this spring. Mitchell has made real strides with his swing, one of the concerns when he was coming out of high school. He hit consistently for the first time in 2019 and he was doing it again during his junior season. He showed plus power in BP and his ability to transfer that to games makes him one of the top picks in the country. Big and strong, Mitchell is an easily plus runner who can steal bases and cover a ton of ground in center field, a premium position he'll be able to play long term with the chance to develop into at least an above-average defender in time. Mitchell has been playing with Type 1 diabetes since being diagnosed in third grade and has shown he can be a premium athlete while dealing with the disease. Armed with perhaps the best collection of tools in this Draft class, the team taking him will be the one that believes he will be able to use those tools consistently in games at the pro level.</span>

The odds of him becoming a Blue Devil decreased, however, when he established himself as the top corner-infield prospect in the 2020 high school class. Georgia has produced a prep position player in the first round of 10 of the last 12 Drafts and he could join that club in June. Walker generates easy bat speed from the right side of the plate and has tremendous leverage and projectable strength in his 6-foot-5 frame, giving him some of the best power potential in this Draft. There are some mixed opinions on his hitting ability because his size creates a naturally long swing and he needs to improve his ability to recognize breaking balls. But he also shows some feel for hitting and the ability to make adjustments, so he should make enough contact to tap into his pop. Athletic for his size, Walker can produce some solid run times but figures to lose a step once he matures physically. He should be able to remain at third base for a while, though if he loses some quickness he'll likely wind up on an outfield corner. He has solid arm strength and has been clocked in the low 90s on the mound, so he should profile well in right field if he has to move.</span>

His arm could have fit in the top three rounds if not for health and signability questions, and he turned down the Braves as a 29th-rounder to attend Oklahoma. After spending most of his freshman season at first base, he focused on pitching as a sophomore and established himself as a likely first-rounder for the 2020 Draft -- though he also missed three weeks with a stress reaction in his arm. Cavalli produces some of the easiest velocity in his Draft class, working at 92-96 mph and topping out at 98 with riding action while expending barely more effort than he would playing catch. He also can make hitters look bad with a low-80s curveball with power and depth, and he has developed an upper-80s slider/cutter that is catching up to his curve. He shows the potential for an average changeup once he starts using the pitch more often. While Cavalli has the upside of a frontline starter, he comes with concerns. Though he has a strong 6-foot-4 frame and clean mechanics, he doesn't have much track record of staying healthy or throwing strikes. His lack of command and deception also means that his premium stuff gets hit harder than it should.</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Back in 2014, Cole Tucker was a bit of a surprise first-round pick out of Mountain Pointe High School in Arizona and he became one of four Mountain Pointe products to make it to the big leagues when he debuted with the Pirates in 2019. His younger brother, Carson, hopes to join them, and though he's a different player and personality than his older brother, he was enjoying a similar rise up Draft boards thanks to a very strong early spring. While more reserved than Cole, Carson has the chance to join his brother as a big league caliber shortstop. At the plate, the right-handed hitter displays excellent bat control and bat speed over power, though he showed added strength this season. He's often content to push the ball the other way and to the right-center field gap, though the ball does jump off his bat. He began showing he can turn on balls and drive them to his pull side more consistently, helping his profile. Tucker has the feet and hands to play shortstop long-term, even though he's an average runner. He has average arm strength, though his throws have good carry and he shows the ability to change arm action and slots as is needed for the premium position. Showing more consistency on the defensive side, along with the aforementioned gains at the bat, are why Tucker's stock took a leap forward this spring, making a stronger case for a team to sign him away from his commitment to the University of Texas.</span>

But when the big right-hander from Eastern Pennsylvania announced that he'd be graduating early, that made him eligible for this year's Draft and put him right up with the top prep arms in the country. Bitsko is 6-foot-4, 220 pounds, with plenty of projection and now stuff. He stood out particularly at the East Coast Pro Showcase over the summer, but he has shown consistent ability at every stop. Bitsko was up to 96-97 mph at East Coast Pro, with all fastballs in the 92- to 96-mph range. He combines it with a hard breaking ball that shows plus shape, thrown in the 78- to 82-mph range to get a lot of swings and misses. While he doesn't throw it as much, he does have solid feel for a changeup. Bitsko isn't pure power, either, showing the ability to throw all three pitches for strikes with a chance for future plus command. Teams were going to have to play some catch-up with Bitsko this spring because they weren't bearing down on him over the summer as much as they were with the incoming senior class, something that couldn't happen beyond an early bullpen session because of the shutdown. He's committed to the University of Virginia, which could come into play, but he has the chance to be an early first-round pick.</span>

He posted a 6.79 ERA in his first two seasons with the Demon Deacons but had much more success in wood-bat summer leagues, earning all-star honors while improving his control and command in Cape Cod last year. When his stuff picked up this spring, he became Wake's best pitching prospect since Kyle Sleeth went No. 3 overall in 2003. Shuster operated at 88-92 mph as recently as last summer but pushed his fastball to 92-94 mph with a peak of 97 this spring, having more success with a riding four-seamer than he did with a sinking two-seamer. His changeup remains his best pitch, sitting around 80 mph with tumble, and he has the confidence to throw it in any count. He still doesn't show great feel for spinning the ball but has come up with a low-80s slurve as an effective third offering. Shuster doesn't have the cleanest delivery but has the strength to make it work and should hold up as a starter. He greatly enhanced his chances of remaining in the rotation long term by finding the strike zone. After issuing 5.2 walks per nine innings in his first two college seasons, he cut that rate to 1.4 between Cape and his truncated junior year.</span>

Three years prior, he was a 15th-round pick out of Turlock High School in California. That's where his son, Tyler, currently plays and while he's not likely to go as high as his dad did out of college, a solid summer at events like the PDP League and Perfect Game All-American Classic have him firmly on the 2020 Draft map. Soderstrom is an athletic, left-handed hitting catcher whose bat is ahead of his defense. At the plate, he's really polished with a solid overall approach and makes the kind of loud contact that makes people sit up and take notice when he's taking batting practice. He's a hitter first, but he will get to his power. He might be a tick above average as a runner, especially for a catcher, and has shown he has the athleticism to play third and even the outfield. That could be important if teams feel he can't catch long-term. He's been the backup catcher on his high school team, mostly because the starter is a really good defender. Soderstrom's hands work and he has a very strong arm, but he is raw in terms of blocking and game management. A team taking him high will be betting that the UCLA recruit's mobility will be an asset and he can develop into an offensive-minded backstop in the big leagues.</span>

He caught fire afterward, batting .380 with 17 dingers in his final 44 contests to set a Tar Heels freshman home run record and claim Atlantic Coast Conference freshman of the year honors. Though surgery on his right shoulder prevented him from showing what he could do with wood bats during the summer, he's still one of the best sophomore-eligible prospects in the 2020 Draft and his power could land him in the first round. A right-handed hitter, Sabato possesses exceptional strength that combines with his bat speed and the loft in his swing to give him well-above-average raw power. While he has a power-over-hit approach, he's patient enough to accept walks when pitchers won't challenge him and doesn't strike out excessively. There are some parallels between him and the college version of Pete Alonso, though Alonso slammed just four homers as a freshman. Almost all of Sabato's value will come from his bat, so he'll have to hit. He worked hard to improve his defense and has reliable hands at first base, but he lacks range and had below-average arm strength before he hurt his shoulder. He's a well-below-average runner with limited athleticism.</span>

The Yankees did take him in the 35th round in 2018 and he's now back as a Draft-eligible sophomore coming off a solid freshman season and very strong Cape Cod League showing. There is no question that Wells' bat plays. The left-handed hitter has power to all fields, with good timing and a simple setup at the plate. He has strength and bat speed and controls the bat head well to make loud contact. He does strike out a bit, but he also draws a lot of walks. There are more concerns about where he might play defensively. He's adequate behind the plate, and while his arm stroke and release are fine, his throws are inconsistent. He is a decent enough athlete to play first or figure things out in left field. A team taking Wells with its first pick might want to send him out as a catcher until he proves he can't play the position. His bat should play regardless of his eventual defensive position and he could end up following a Kyle Schwarber type path to the big leagues.</span>

A 38th-round pick that June by the Orioles, Miller moved into the Cardinals' weekend rotation last March as a sophomore and has boosted his stock since. He took a no-hitter into the ninth inning of an NCAA super-regional playoff against East Carolina and wowed scouts with his velocity and slider during fall practice. Miller's fastball is notable for both its heat -- he sat at 95-96 mph throughout his dominance of East Carolina and worked at 97-99 in shorter stints in the fall -- and its heavy life. He also can miss bats with a slider/cutter that usually operates at 85-87 and reached 90 during the fall. He has faith in a splitter/changeup with similar velocity and employs a more traditional change in the low 80s. With his strong 6-foot-5 frame, Miller has no difficulty maintaining his stuff into the late innings. However, there's effort in his delivery that limits his control and has some scouts wondering if he's destined to be a reliever in the long run. After maintaining his improved stuff and doing a better job of throwing strikes during the brief 2020 season, he could join Detmers in the first round.</span>

He spent most of his freshman season in center field and broke the hamate bone in his left hand during the season opener as a sophomore, costing him a month and limiting him after he returned. He performed well this spring, giving him a chance to become the third first-round pick in Ohio State history, following Nick Swisher (2002) and Alex Wimmers (2010). Dingler reminds area scouts of former Wright State catcher Sean Murphy, a 2016 Athletics third-rounder who has blossomed into one of baseball's top catching prospects. He doesn't quite have Murphy's plus-plus cannon but he does possess well above-average arm strength and his accuracy continues to get better as he gains experience. His receiving also continues to improve and he shows more athleticism and mobility than most backstops. While Dingler batted just .267/.362/.396 in his first two college seasons, he controls the strike zone well and has plus raw power, so he should be able to hold his own as a right-handed hitter. He ran a sub-6.6-second 60-yard dash during the Buckeyes' scout day this fall, though he probably won't maintain plus speed as he stays behind the plate. In addition to his physical tools, he also offers strong makeup and was voted an Ohio State captain as a sophomore.</span>

Old Farms School produced an athletic center fielder in 2008 who went on to become a first-round pick after three years in college and an eventual star with the Astros -- George Springer. A decade later, the Beavers spawned another toolsy center fielder who should go early in the 2020 Draft as a sophomore-eligible. A 39th-round pick by the Athletics in 2018, Haskin batted .372/.459/.647 as a Tulane freshman and helped his cause by performing well with wood bats in the New England Collegiate Baseball League during the summer. Though Haskin's right-handed swing can get long at times, he still manages to barrel the ball consistently. His stroke is quick and has nice loft, and once he fills out his lean 6-foot-2 frame he could produce 20 or more homers annually. He manages the strike zone well, though his ability to make contact with ease does cut into his walks. Haskin's speed grades as at least plus. Though he broke Springer's stolen base record at Avon Old Farms, he hasn't been especially aggressive on the bases in college. He tracks balls well in center field, showing good instincts and an average arm.</span>

Neither will pitch in high school this spring, however, because Savino will bypass his senior season and the Draft to enroll early at Virginia and Fulton underwent Tommy John surgery in September. The latter still could be the first prep southpaw selected in June and could sneak into the supplemental first round. Before he got hurt at the U.S. 18-and-under national team trials in August, Fulton worked with a 90-93 mph fastball that played better than its velocity because he creates steep downhill plane with his 6-foot-6 frame and high three-quarters arm slot. He's already strong and has the room to add more muscle, so he could work in the mid-90s once he regains his health. His curveball is a legitimate plus pitch with power and depth, and he shows some feel to manipulate its break. Fulton's changeup should be an average or better offering once he spends more time developing it. For such a tall teenager, he does a nice job of keeping his long limbs in sync and throwing strikes with his entire repertoire. After verbally committing to Vanderbilt, he officially signed with Oklahoma.</span>

He also excelled at the Under Armour All-America Game, striking out the side in a perfect ninth inning. Part of a De La Salle Institute (Chicago) program that has produced four big leaguers, including outfielder/Hall of Fame umpire Jocko Conlan, he has committed to Illinois-Chicago and will be eligible for the 2022 Draft as a sophomore if he attends college. Hernandez finished each of his Under Armour whiffs with his devastating changeup, which ranks as the best in the 2020 high school class. It's a low-80s offering with filthy fade, and he'll throw it in any count and isn't afraid to double or triple up on it. He sets up his changeup with a 90-95 mph fastball that features some sink and plays up because he locates it well. Hernandez uses a decent mid-70s curveball as his third offering. There's not a lot of projection remaining in his strong 6-foot-2 frame, but he makes the most of what he has and exhibits advanced feel for pitching. His delivery features little effort and he repeats it well.</span>

After spending his freshman year pitching out of the bullpen, he made a smooth transition to the Seminoles' rotation as a sophomore and is now near the top of a solid crop of college pitchers in the Sunshine State eligible for the 2020 Draft. Van Eyk has a solid three-pitch mix that he knows how to use extremely well. He's been up to 95 mph, usually working in the 93-94 mph range, with his fastball and commands it well to both sides of the plate. He really knows how to spin his curveball, a breaking ball with almost 12-to-6 action that has really good late downward bite. He throws it in the upper-70s more often than not, but can add and subtract as needed. His changeup is his third pitch, and would be more effective if it had more sink, but he does throw it with good arm speed to fool hitters. The Florida State ace is capable of being a complete pitcher because of his willingness to pitch in with his fastball, his ability to throw his breaking ball at any point in the count and his feel for mixing his pitches to keep hitters off-balance, though issues with his command persisted over his first four starts in 2020. His potential as a starter still should have him in consideration in the top two rounds of the Draft.</span>

After appearing to break out by winning the 2019 Cape batting title (.353), he returned to College Station and once again underwhelmed area scouts during fall practice. He beat up on a soft schedule during the truncated 2020 season, hitting .421 with six homers in 18 games and ranking 11th in NCAA Division I with a 1.336 OPS. A streaky hitter, DeLoach is at his best when he turns his left-handed swing loose, which he did more frequently during his brief junior year. He could go as high as the second round to a team that buys into the guy they saw on the Cape who drove the ball with authority with wood bats. He always has excelled at controlling the strike zone and putting the bat on the ball, but he too often adopted an almost defensive approach and settled for weak contact in his first two seasons with the Aggies. More of an average runner in the past, DeLoach flashed some plus times from home to first this spring. That helps his chances of staying in center field, though his so-so instincts likely will land him on a corner. His average to solid arm should fit in either left or right field, positions that will increase the demands on his bat.</span>

While his father, Keith, spent two summers as an infielder in the D-backs system, Jared's future is definitely on the mound. Jones will show three usable pitches, though he's more arm strength than pitchability at this point in his young career. But there's plenty of arm to like, with a fastball that is up to 96-97 mph on a consistent basis, thrown with good tail. He'll flash a solid slider that he adds and subtracts from, but it's at its best when it's the harder 80-82 mph version of the pitch and not the more slurvy 74-78 mph offering. He does miss bats with it, though a lower elbow in his delivery leads to him getting underneath it at times. He doesn't need his changeup much now, and it's a bit firm, but the 85-88 mph offspeed pitch has the chance to give him a third at least average offering. Jones' command has been inconsistent at best, not unusual for a prep power pitcher. While he's not the biggest guy in the world, he's strong and athletic, getting good genes from both his father and his mother, who played collegiate softball. Initially committed to attend Southern California, Jones switched to Texas when USC coach Dan Hubbs was fired.</span>

While Caissie doesn't project to be a first-round pick in this year's Draft, he is one of two Canadian prep outfielders who have a very good chance to get taken in the first several rounds. Caissie, a Michigan recruit, has the tools to fit the right field profile very well, starting with his plus raw power. He has legit pop from the left side of the plate, with the ability to drive the ball to all fields. Some scouts have questioned his bat path, leading to some concerns about his ability to get to that power, but he has shown the ability to make adjustments in the past. He's at least an above-average runner, one who gets to plus once underway. In deference to the other Canadian outfielder on this list, David Calabrese, Caissie has played a corner outfield spot for the Canadian junior national team. With an arm that delivers low-90s throws from the outfield and his power potential, he fits that mold very well. A team that thinks he has the chops to handle center, and he might, could consider him a bit higher.</span>

The former three-sport standout (soccer and basketball) slid in the Draft, going in the 33rd round, and opted to go to Miami instead. A knee injury cut short his freshman year, and his sophomore year was up-and-down as the Hurricanes' Saturday starter. But he was one of the best performers for USA Baseball's Collegiate National Team, something that carried over to the start of his junior season. The right-hander has more than enough stuff to succeed as a starter at the next level. His fastball is up to 95-96 mph consistently, with late action on it down in the zone, and he was up to 98 mph this fall. He knows how to spin a breaking ball, but it gets caught in between being a curve and slider, looking more like the former. He has a very good feel for his changeup that can miss bats and get ground-ball outs. When he's on, McMahon combines athleticism, stuff, feel for pitching and command to make him a complete package. With an arm action that can be a little deep, he can get flat and gets hit more than he should. He got out front more consistently and didn't leave pitches up for Team USA and early this spring, solidifying his spot as one of the more solid college arms in the class.</span>

Kelley entered the year rated as the nation's top high school prospect and is regarded as Texas' best prep pitcher since Jameson Taillon went No. 2 overall in 2010. He repeatedly dominated on the showcase circuit last summer, including an Area Code Games performance that some scouts said was the best in the long history of the event. Few pitchers can create as much velocity with as little effort as Kelley, who can pump 93-96 mph fastballs and reach 98 with some running action. He already owns an advanced changeup with fade and sink, and he's willing to throw it in any count. His third-best pitch at the moment is a hard slurve in the low 80s that lacks consistency but should develop into at least a solid offering. Kelley combines his now stuff with feel for pitching. The Texas recruit pounds the strike zone and has the look of a frontline starter who could reach the big leagues before he turns 21. His strong, physically mature frame and the ease of his delivery should allow him to log plenty of innings.</span>

His stuff and command fell off against better competition in his next two outings before the season abruptly ended, leaving clubs unsure what exactly to make of him. Nevertheless, he and projected top-five-overall pick Asa Lacy give Texas A&amp;M its best lefty-righty prospect duo since Chance Caple and Casey Fossum went in the first 48 selections in 1999. Roa initially sat at 92-94 mph with his fastball this spring, peaking at 96 with some armside run before his heater lost a couple of ticks of velocity and straightened out. All three of his secondary pitches are at least solid when he's at his best. Scouts debate whether his hard 11-5 curveball or fading, sinking changeup is better, while his low-80s slider is his least consistent offering. Roa has thrown strikes throughout his college career, averaging 2.0 walks per nine innings until issuing eight free passes in nine frames in his final two starts. Even before his late downturn, his control was significantly ahead of his command, so he'll have to do a better job of locating his pitches. He uses his strong 6-foot-4 build and an overhand delivery to create difficult downhill angle.</span>

Then there are lesser-known players, like the Angels' Jared Walsh, who have gotten the opportunity to both pitch and hit at the higher levels. Schmitt is the top two-way guy in the college ranks for the Class of 2020, who could fit a Walsh-like profile as a power-hitting corner infielder/relief pitcher. Schmitt has served as San Diego State's closer over his first two seasons, racking up 17 saves with a fastball-splitter combination. He has a clean and easy delivery and consistently gets his fastball up to 94 mph, while keeping it fairly true. He'll throw the splitter 77-80 mph, and he has shown the ability to miss bats with it, something he did well while pitching in the Cape Cod League. His raw power, his best offensive tool, also showed up on the Cape as he homered five times with a wood bat, equaling his total during his sophomore year with the Aztecs. He's a solid defender at third with that plus arm enabling him to make every throw from the hot corner. There is a bit of a split in the scouting industry over liking Schmitt as a hitter or a pitcher. Some see more upside as a power-hitting third baseman, while others think he could move quickly as a reliever only, providing some intrigue over his future as the Draft approached.</span>

His velocity began to climb as a freshman but he was so raw that he made just two appearances and retired only one of the seven batters he faced. He made a huge leap forward as a sophomore, averaging 15.6 strikeouts per nine innings as the Patriots' closer and becoming the first player in school history to make the U.S. collegiate national team. The favorite to be the first reliever drafted in 2020, Carraway has a pair of overpowering pitches in his fastball and curveball. His heater sits at 93-96 mph and touches 98 with riding action, while his downer curve usually parks in the upper 70s. His pitches play up because they have high spin rates and he gets good extension in his delivery, and both can grade as well above average when at their best. As a 6-footer who lacks physicality and features a lot of effort in his high three-quarters delivery, Carraway is strictly a reliever. His control and command have improved in college but still need to get better if he's going to hold down a high-leverage role in the big leagues. He should be one of the first players from the 2020 Draft to reach the Majors.</span>

He earned Southeastern Conference freshman of the year honors in his college debut, capping his season with six scoreless innings in a College World Series start against Louisville. Projected as a likely 2020 first-rounder as a Draft-eligible sophomore, he made just one three-inning appearance this spring before requiring Tommy John surgery. When healthy, Ginn usually deals at 91-95 mph and tops out at 97 with some of the best fastball life in the 2020 Draft, as his heater will run and sink and bore at various times. His wipeout slider can be just as difficult to hit, combining mid-80s velocity with two-plane depth. He also gets good downward action on his changeup, which shows flashes of becoming a plus offering. Despite the movement on his pitches, Ginn controls and commands them well, giving up just 19 walks and one homer in 86 1/3 innings as a freshman. He has toned down his delivery since high school, lessening concerns that he'll wind up in the bullpen in the long run. He's athletic but already came with durability concerns after a sore arm limited him at times during the second half of the 2019 season.</span>

The younger Zamora had been a starter since he set foot on Miami's campus, and after being a glove-only type of middle infielder, improvements in his offensive game had him much higher on Draft boards as he was set to begin his junior season with the Hurricanes. That progress came to a screeching halt when he was first suspended for violating team rules before the start of the season, then suffered a knee injury in practice that will shelved him for the rest of the year.  At his best, Zamora has the skill set to be an everyday player at a premium position. He can be a plus defender at times, with a lot of body control, range and wing span at his disposal to go along with an easily plus arm. He's made strides at the plate to make him a more well-rounded player. He's very short to the ball with a contact-oriented approach that makes him tough to strike out, and he started showing more extra-base pop during his sophomore year, though he tailed off at the end of the year. Zamora is an average runner, especially once underway, and he's shown the ability to steal bases, though he was nursing a hamstring injury this fall and will have to show there are no ill-effects from the knee injury. He can play with a low motor at times, but with his overall skill set, and he'll now have to answer questions about his makeup, but he has the tools to be a top three-round talent.</span>

He's a legitimate two-way prospect as a short but talented shortstop with a live arm that can deliver upper-90s fastballs on the mound, and he also comes with makeup concerns because he got sent home early from the inaugural PDP League in July. He was the talk of the World Wood Bat Association World Championship in October, when he touched 98 mph with his fastball, backed it up with two plus secondary pitches and homered in the same game. Winn has a higher ceiling on the mound, where he has a pair of high-spin-rate weapons in a heater that sits at 92-96 mph with riding action and a curveball that ranges from 79-82 mph. His low-80s changeup isn't as consistent as his fastball and curve but can give him a third plus offering at its best. His size and the effort in his delivery lead to questions as to whether he can hold up as a starter, but his athleticism and lightning-fast arm help his cause. Some scouts prefer Winn as a shortstop and he profiles as a regular there. The Arkansas recruit still needs to refine his hitting ability from the right side of the plate but he possesses plus raw power and solid speed with good instincts on the bases. His arm is an obvious asset and he has the quickness to make plays.</span>

He missed fall practice with a stress reaction in his upper arm, then emerged as LSU's best starter as a freshman before missing a month with a sore elbow. He's one of the best Draft-eligible sophomores in the 2020 Draft -- provided he can stay healthy. Henry has the potential for three solid to plus pitches. His fastball usually runs from 90-94 mph and tops out at 96 with riding or sinking action, and he could add some more velocity once he gets stronger. His mid-70s downer curveball gives him a second plus pitch when it's on, while his mid-80s changeup has some depth and continues to get better. When he was in high school, Henry's delivery featured a lot of effort and some head whack. He has improved his mechanics in college and had no trouble providing strikes as a freshman. He has the look of a durable mid-rotation starter but must prove he can stay on the mound.</span>

He headed to Florida International as a two-way player and continued to hit and pitch for two-plus years, but his future as a pro is certainly on the mound. In many respects, Allen is the same pitchabilty lefty that he was in high school, just with more track record after two years at FIU and a strong performance on the Cape last summer. He goes right after hitters with three pitches. He sits right around 90 mph with his fastball, but can reach back for up to 93 mph when he needs to, and he commands it well, with good arm-side finish. His changeup is his bread and butter, a potentially future plus circle change he sells really well with good fade and sink that misses bats and elicits weak contact on the ground. His curveball is his third pitch, a breaking ball that can get a little big at times. He commands the ball very well and knows how to set up hitters. Because of his lack of physicality and lack of wow stuff, Allen's ceiling is somewhat limited. But he's shown the ability to keep hitters off-balance and could be the kind of advanced college lefty who moves through a system quickly, always a commodity when the Draft rolls around.</span>

Seymour, a lefty who was off to a very strong start to his third year in the Virginia Tech rotation before things got shut down, has a good chance to beat both of those records. Seymour isn't the biggest guy in the world at six-feet, but his stuff took a nice step forward at the start of the spring. After throwing mostly in the 88-90 mph range during a successful stint in the Cape Cod League last summer, the southpaw came out throwing his fastball in the 90-94 range and sitting 92-93 mph consistently. Hitters could not square the pitch up thanks to Seymour's deception and very heavy life to the pitch. His best secondary pitch is his above-average changeup, an offspeed offering that serves as his strikeout pitch. His breaking ball is fringy at best, a hard slider that tends to get too slurvy. The shortened season didn't allow scouts to see if Seymour's fastball gains were for real, but that plus his success on the Cape have some reminded of a lefty like Zac Lowther with a bit more velocity. Teams that are in will give him the chance to start, with the chance of him becoming a fastball-changeup lefty reliever a possibility.</span>

He dominated as a reliever for the Wolverines as a freshman, then served as one of the best No. 3 starters in college baseball in 2019. He became a bullpen weapon again at the College World Series, getting crucial outs behind second-round picks Karl Kaufmann and Tommy Henry as Michigan came within a victory of the national title. Criswell took over as the Wolverines' Friday starter in 2020 and has the stuff to go in the same range as Kauffmann and Henry did. He maintained his velocity while transitioning from reliever to starter, showing the ability to work at 93-96 mph with heavy sink for several innings at a time. Both his slider and his fading changeup are solid secondary pitches that arrive in the low 80s. While Criswell unquestionably has the repertoire and strong build to start at the pro level, he's still learning to harness his stuff. He lapses into overthrowing at times, which causes his delivery to get out of sync and his control to waver. If he can do a better job of locating his pitches, he could develop into a mid-rotation starter.</span>

He went undrafted as a Texas prepster in 2017 and went in the 29th round to the Cardinals a year later after hitting .402/.513/.745 with 10 homers and 23 steals at San Jacinto (Texas) JC. After verbally committing to Arkansas and then-recruiting coordinator Tony Vitello out of high school, he reunited with Vitello (now the head coach at Tennessee) in 2019 and finished second in the Southeastern Conference in on-base percentage (.466) and third in batting (.357) and slugging (.602). Soularie has excellent feel for recognizing and barreling pitches, making consistent line-drive contact to all fields while controlling the strike zone. His right-handed swing isn't geared for home runs, though he makes the most of his average to solid raw power, and his hitting ability could translate into 20 homers per year. While he possesses just fringy speed, he's aggressive on the bases. Though scouts have regarded Soularie as a tweener who lacks the quickness for center fielder and the power to start on a corner, his track record of production could land him in the top three rounds. A center field at San Jac, he played left field as a sophomore and his instincts enhanced his range. He has below-average arm strength but showed reliable hands when he took ground balls at second base in the fall.</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 52  The best fifth-year-senior prospect in years, Knack could go as early as the second or third round to a team looking to marry intriguing talent with a deep discount to create bonus pool wiggle room in a shortened Draft. He tore the labrum in his right (pitching) shoulder diving into a base and required surgery as a Tennessee high school senior in 2015 that led to him redshirting in his first year at Walters State (Tenn.) CC. He dislocated his left shoulder diving into a bag when he returned in 2017, costing him most of that year, before bouncing back to go 13-0 and hit 11 homers while leading the Senators to a runner-up finish at the 2018 Junior College World Series. Knack continued to win and pound the strike zone at East Tennessee State last spring but went undrafted for the fourth straight year, then took a dramatic leap forward in stuff and performance this spring. He won all four of his starts with a 1.08 ERA and led NCAA Division I in strikeouts (51 in 25 innings) and K-BB ratio (51-1). The quality of Knack's pitches improved somewhat when he gave up hitting in 2019, but he still operated with an 89-92 mph fastball and fringy secondary pitches. After a summer spent lifting weights and firming up his burly 6-foot-2 frame, he worked at 93-95 mph deep into games and touched 98 during the shortened season. He tightened his slider into a consistently solid offering, added power to what had been a get-me-over curveball and continued to demonstrate feel for his changeup. Knack doesn't have the prettiest body or delivery but has a long history of throwing strikes, averaging 1.3 walks per nine innings throughout his college career. The brother-in-law of Pirates 2016 first-rounder Will Craig, he presents a conundrum to teams because he turns 23 in July and his history of premium velocity lasts just four weeks. It's an unusual story for sure, but few pitchers in this Draft can match the stuff and command he showed this spring.</span>

He won all of his four starts, giving up just four runs and six walks in the process, vaulting into consideration in the top three rounds of the Draft. Though he succeeded in a small sample size as a starter, he showed better stuff coming out of the bullpen, so his long-term role is uncertain. Working out of the rotation, Swiney showed an 87-93 mph fastball with modest life and an average to plus curveball. As a reliever in the past, he sat in the low 90s and topped out at 95 with his heater and backed it up with a wipeout curve. His changeup was a revelation this spring, showing signs of becoming a plus offering with deceptive fade. Swiney slashed his walk rate from 5.0 per nine innings in his first two years to 1.9 in his shortened third. There's still some question as to whether he can throw quality strikes and maintain his stuff over a long season because his delivery features effort. Nevertheless, he's the Wolfpack's best pitching prospect since Carlos Rodon was the No. 3 overall choice in the 2014 Draft.</span>

One of the better hitters among this year's college shortstops, he missed the first weekend of his junior year recovering from offseason elbow surgery and didn't play in the field before the season ended. He could go in the first five rounds and is a righty-hitting version of the only Dallas Baptist infielder ever to do so (Ryan Goins, fourth round, 2009), albeit with less arm strength. Glowenke's lone better-than-average tool is his bat, as he makes line-drive contact with ease. He controls the strike zone well and enhances his on-base ability by getting hit by more than his share of pitches. He can provide some doubles and perhaps 10-12 homers per season at the next level, but he didn't drive the ball with wood bats on the Cape.  Glowenke's below-average speed almost certainly will push him to second base in pro ball. He's a sure-handed defender at shortstop, but he lacks the range to stay there. His average arm may be enough to get by at third base in a utility role, though neither it nor his power fits the profile to play regularly at the hot corner.</span>

He jumped onto the map with a very strong Area Code Games and then really stood out as part of a scout team that played against USA Baseball's 18-and-under team before it headed to international competition this fall. Greene has as impressive raw tools as anyone in Southern California. There's no doubt he can stay in center field, where his plus speed will allow him to stay in the long-term, though he has much to learn in terms of reads and routes. That speed also allows him to be aggressive on the basepaths. He can really hit with a contact-oriented approach. His swing is pretty flat, but he still can drive the ball at times, with scouts thinking power will come as he figures that part of his game out. He's relying on hand-eye coordination and feel for the barrel more than his swing mechanics and approach at the plate. Even without much polish, Greene really stood out against top competition over the summer and fall. Though he didn't hit as well out of the gate this spring, he may be the most improved player in the area over the last year and there's still plenty of room for growth, giving teams reason to consider the Missouri recruit in the early rounds.</span>

It should happen again in 2020 with righty Gavin Williams and Burleson. Though Burleson is one of the top two-way performers in college baseball and pulled double duty for the U.S. collegiate national team last summer, clubs consider him a much better prospect as a hitter than as a pitcher. Burleson has a pretty left-handed swing and seems to make line-drive contact almost at will. Most of his pop has gone to the gaps rather than over the fence in college, leading to questions about his home run ceiling. Some evaluators see him as a hit-over-power guy who will max out at 15 homers, while others envision his strength, bat speed and solid raw pop translating into 20 or more on an annual basis. Though Burleson is a better athlete than he gets credit for, he still lacks speed and range and will need to hit for power to become a big league regular. He shows good hands and plays solid defense at first base but doesn't cover enough ground to man the outfield corners in pro ball after seeing time there with the Pirates. On the mound, he's a finesse lefty who backs up an 87-90 mph fastball with an effective slider and changeup.</span>

The most recent high Draft pick was shortstop Jeter Downs, taken 32nd overall by the Reds and now a highly regarded prospect in the Red Sox's system. Infante, who stood out at events like the East Coast Pro Showcase last summer, hopes to follow in Downs' footsteps as a middle infielder from the school to the pro game, though he isn't expected to go quite as early. Infante has shown glimpses of being able to do a lot of different things well on the baseball field, even if he doesn't have a true wow tool. Over the summer, he showed an ability to make hard contact and drive the ball. There have been contact issues in the past, but he was making adjustments and there's some raw power to tap into there. Infante is an average runner, and the jury is still out as to whether he can stay at shortstop. Those who believe he can point to his strong arm and decent actions. Others feel he lacks the quickness to stay there and might be better suited at second or third, where there would be more pressure on the power to show up. And there are some who see a future Maikel Franco type of player. A team that believes his tools will translate to the pro game is likely to take him early enough to sign him away from his Miami commitment.</span>

Leury Tejada was a 10th-rounder in 2018 who signed with the Rangers. Santos is a fellow Bronx native who has the chance to do much better than that after a strong summer showcase circuit performance that included a spot on USA Baseball's 40-man 18U National Team Trials roster. Santos is tall and projectable with long limbs who has the chance to have a three-pitch mix, though he's a bit raw. Over the summer, he consistently showed a fastball in the 90-94 range with good life, sitting in the 92-93 mph range in most of his outings. Given his size and a frame that should allow him to add strength, it's easy to dream about velocity gains. He'll throw a 76-78 mph slider to complement the fastball and he has good feel for a changeup that touches the low-80s. While he's more projection than now stuff, Santos did show an ability to pitch without his best stuff during the Area Code Games, pitching more off his changeup effectively. Teams might have to be patient, but the Maryland recruit is the kind of high-ceiling prep arms that many organizations covet.</span>

His uncle Enrique started at second base for the 2003 College World Series champions at Rice, where Trei has spent the last three seasons. Selected in the 35th round out of high school by the Astros in 2017 and in the 37th round as a sophomore-eligible by the Nationals in 2019, he should fit in the first five rounds after improving several aspects of his game. A switch-hitter, Cruz has toned down his approach after selling out for home runs in the past. He has modified a big leg kick he used from the left side of the plate and displayed better strike-zone discipline during the truncated 2020 season. Scouts see him as a hit-over-power guy who could provide 15 homers on an annual basis. Cruz posted below-average running times in the past but now flashes average speed, especially once he gets going, and shows aggressiveness and savvy on the bases. His average arm and fringy range don't lend themselves to sticking at shortstop, though he may get a chance to play there for a while in pro ball after displaying more quickness this spring. His best fit is at second base, where he played well as a freshman.</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 60                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Servideo played sparingly as a Mississippi freshman in 2018, then spent most of 2019 shuttling between right field and center field for the Rebels before posting the worst batting line (.149/.228/.277) in the Cape Cod League. He looked like a different player this spring, starting on Opening Day by singling, doubling and walking against Louisville left-hander Reid Detmers, a lock top-10-overall pick. He emerged as one of college baseball's better shortstops, though scouts can only wonder how his .390/.575/.695 line would have held up in Southeastern Conference play. Servideo plays a table-setting role, working counts to draw walks (his 24 in 17 games ranked second in NCAA Division I) and aggressively using his plus speed to create havoc once he reaches base. To remain at the top of the order at the next level, he'll need to cut down his left-handed swing a bit and make more consistent contact. He's not big and won't be a slugger, but he displayed more pop as a junior, homering five times after going deep just four times in 100 previous contests. While there still are mixed opinions on how much impact Servideo will have at the plate, there are no questions about his ability to play shortstop. His quickness and solid arm make him a better defender than Grae Kessinger, his predecessor as Mississippi's shortstop and the Astros' second-round pick last June. If he doesn't hit enough to be a regular, he'd be capable of playing anywhere in the infield and outfield as a utility man.</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 61                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Coastal Carolina has produced just three top-three-rounds picks in the last 33 Drafts but could have two this year in McCambley and toolsy outfielder Parker Chavers (who was sidelined all spring following shoulder surgery). McCambley attracted scouting interest as a Pennsylvania high schooler, but had a minor knee injury as a senior and wasn't considered signable, so he went undrafted in 2017. He lacked consistency while bouncing between the rotation and bullpen in his first two seasons with the Chanticleers, but he helped his cause with a strong summer in the Cape Cod League. McCambley appeals to teams that love high spin rates, which he has on both his curveball and fastball. He owns one of the better curves in his Draft class, with his low-80s bender diving hard at the plate and earning well above-average grades at times. It plays well off his 90-94 mph heater that tops out at 96 and features riding action. To make it as a starter in pro ball, McCambley will need to refine his nascent changeup and improve his control and command. There's some effort in his three-quarters delivery that restricts him from locating his fastball where he wants, and his curveball breaks so much that more advanced hitters may refuse to chase it. If he can't stick in the rotation, he has the stuff to serve as a high-leverage reliever.</span>

CC and helped the Senators reach the finals of the 2018 Junior College World Series. He topped Alabama in most offensive categories in 2019 and again this spring, when he ranked among the NCAA Division I leaders in all three slash stats (.429/.554/.750) during the shortened season. He could go as early as the second round, which would make him the Crimson Tide's highest pick since Mikey White went there in 2015. Gentry's most attractive tool is his right-handed power, which carries to all fields and played against top competition in the Southeastern Conference and the Cape Cod League. He has an aggressive swing and approach, though he did a better job of controlling the strike zone during the brief 2020 season. He shows the ability to hit for both average and power if he maintains his plate discipline. Though it's his bat that will get him drafted, Gentry also offers some underrated athleticism. He has solid speed and arm strength, enabling him to provide quality defense in right field. He's capable of playing all three outfield positions and profiles best in right.</span>

While Palmer obviously hasn't been as scouted as any of his Dolphins predecessors, his arm strength and strong start to his spring, not to mention a successful turn as a reliever last summer on Cape, has his name popping up in the same area of the Draft. While not a prototype for a starting pitcher size-wise (6-foot-1, 230 pounds), some scouts do feel he has the chance to stick in a rotation because of his ability to maintain velocity and have a three- or four-pitch mix. He throws his fastball in the 91-96 mph range with good sink and he backs it up with a pair of solid secondary offerings. His changeup is a splitter thrown with good arm speed and downward action in the 82-84 mph range, and he throws a 79-83 mph slider with sweeping action, but with some depth. He can toss in a slower curveball in the low 70s, but it's definitely a fourth pitch. Command has been an issue at times for Palmer and he has more experience out of the pen than in a rotation, leading many scouts to want to make him a reliever at the next level. If teams saw enough of his very strong opening to 2020 (1.30 ERA, 41/5 K/BB ratio in four starts) to believe he has the chance to start, he could join Baumann and Hays in the top three rounds.</span>

After spending the first semester of his college career at Kentucky and playing his first two seasons at Northwest Florida State JC, he batted .344/.494/.578 with 19 walks and eight steals in 18 games for Oklahoma State this spring. The stocky 5-foot-8 switch-hitter performed well in the Cape Cod League last summer as well, though he profiles more as utilityman than as a regular.</span>

HS, Garcia headed to Division III Chapman as an infielder. He appeared in just 24 games as a freshman then moved to the mound as a sophomore. He found immediate success in the bullpen, winning nine games and saving 12 more to help the Panthers win a national title, earning College World Series Most Outstanding Player honors in the process. After pitching well out of the pen on the Cape last summer, Garcia moved into the rotation at the start of his junior year and created a lot of early buzz in the process. The 6-foot-4 right-hander has shown glimpses of three pitches that have the chance to be above average. He came out of the gate this spring throwing much harder than in the past, showcasing a fastball consistently up to 97 mph. He backs it up with a mid-80s slider and an 86-88 mph cutter, though he hasn't shown much of a changeup in the past. Garcia's command has been spotty at times, but he's generally around the strike zone, and given his athletic delivery and arm action, there's some confidence he'll improve on this front in the future. He doesn't have a ton of track record against good competition - the stint on the Cape helped a bit - or as a starter, but he's a relatively fresher arm with perhaps more projection than most college pitchers.</span>

Wilcox also drew first-round interest in 2018 and finished ahead of fellow Georgia prep products Ethan Hankins (the Indians' first-rounder that June) and Kumar Rocker (the projected No. 1 overall choice in 2021) in MLB Pipeline's final rankings. A Draft-eligible sophomore, he opened his first college season in Georgia's bullpen and moved into the weekend rotation for the final month. Wilcox has some of the best pure stuff in the Draft. His fastball usually ranges from 92-97 mph and can reach 100 with some sink and armside run. Both of his mid-80s secondary pitches show signs of becoming plus offerings, with his fading changeup a tick more reliable than his power slider. Though Wilcox is athletic and has a strong, durable frame, he comes with starter-versus-reliever questions. Scouts don't love his delivery, which features a low elbow and a long arm stroke that allows hitters to track the ball well out of his hand. His fastball has a history of getting hit harder than it should and he sometimes struggles to provide quality strikes.</span>

After turning down the Blue Jays as a 27th-round pick, Weatherly has gone from two-way player to reliever to starter with the Tigers. He was spectacular in the brief 2020 season, allowing two runs in four starts while ranking among the NCAA Division I leaders in opponent average (.096, seventh), strikeouts (43, seventh) and strikeout rate (17.1 per nine innings, eighth). Weatherly's best pitch is a low-80s slider that consistently grades as plus and can wipe out both left-handers and right-handers. He sets it up with a 91-94 mph fastball that tops out at 96 with good spin rates that create riding life that leads to swings and misses up in the strike zone. His changeup is improving as he uses it more often as a starter and shows the makings of an average third pitch. Weatherly has the stuff to start and a 6-foot-4 frame built for durability. He's also more athletic than most pitchers and his arm works well, which makes his struggles to throw strikes baffling. He commands his slider better than his fastball and will land in the bullpen if he can't do a better job of finding the zone.</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  There has been a player from Ontario taken in the top three rounds of the Draft every year since 2014, including a pair of first-rounders in the Naylor brothers, Josh and Bo. Calabrese, a speedy outfielder who was initially slated to be a 2021 product but reclassified for this year and who was named to the Canadian Junior National Team this fall, hopes to keep that streak going in 2020. While Calabrese is not the biggest guy in the world at 5-foot-10, he has some tools sure to attract attention. His speed stands out the most and it's close to top of the scale, with some evaluators recording 80 grades for the outfielder. It should allow him to be a basestealing threat and to cover a lot of ground in the outfield. At the plate, the left-handed hitter has a loose and easy swing geared for hard contact. He's a gap-to-gap hitter who can use the whole field who has come on fast offensively and while his game is really built around his speed and defense, he could grow into more power as he matures. He has adequate arm strength and it plays up because he makes accurate throws. It's more than enough for center field, where he should be able to play long-term. Calabrese committed to Arkansas in the fall, and the Razorbacks might hope he can develop into another Andrew Benintendi type if he gets to campus. A team that feels the same way might try to sign him away from that commitment, with many organizations likely to like the fact he'll still be just 17 years old at the Draft.</span>

Signability concerns dropped him to the 26th round and the Cubs, after which he reached the College World Series with two different schools in two years. He transferred from Arkansas after 2018 because the Razorbacks saw him solely as a reliever, and though he won Texas Tech's super-regional clincher and his lone CWS start last June, he has been inconsistent in the rotation.  Bonnin has a pair of legitimate plus pitches in his fastball and slider, which derive tremendous life from his crossfire delivery. His heater sits at 93-95 mph and tops out at 97 with riding action, while his slider parks in the mid-80s and knifes across the plate. He also has a hard curveball and a changeup, both of which can be average offerings. Bonnin's quality athleticism should help him in his quest to be a starter, but he throws across his body and with effort. He has trouble keeping his mechanics in sync, resulting in below-average control and command. His live arm remains attractive to pro teams, however, even if it's looking increasingly likely that he'll wind up in the bullpen.</span>

Harrison has been a key part of two, including winning the championship game as a junior before embarking on a successful summer showcase circuit that culminated with a very strong turn on USA Baseball's 18U National Team. Harrison has the chance to be a very solid left-handed starter with a three-pitch mix and a feel to use all three offerings well. He's been up to 93 mph with his fastball, usually sitting closer to 90-91 mph, throwing his heater with good life. It's tough to square up coming from a difficult angle thanks to a three-quarter slot. His slider is his out pitch, an upper-70s breaking ball that's especially tough on left-handed hitters. He also has good feel for his changeup and commands all of his pitches well. There are some who might see Harrison, a UCLA recruit, as having a limited ceiling. His pitchability and the deception of his delivery from the left side does give him a higher floor than most high school pitchers and makes him one of the top prep lefties in the class.</span>

Roby had impressed some scouts over the summer and backed it up at the start of the spring, though the early end of the season kept him from being as seen as much as he would've been under normal circumstances, when scouts would've headed to Pensacola as word of Roby's stuff spread. Roby has the makings of a very solid three-pitch mix, coming from a solid frame, loose delivery, long arms and loose wrist action that allows for good movement on his pitches. He'll throw his fastball in the 89-94 mph range, with excellent sinking life. He complements it with a 74-78 mph downer-breaking curveball, a pitch that's at least above-average in the future. He does have a changeup, but he needs to work on developing it to catch it up with his fastball-curve combination. The right-hander who is committed to Troy University tends to be around the strike zone, but needs to improve his overall control and command. While he's not the biggest guy in the world, there is some projection here, with teams considering him in the top few rounds seeing a potential No. 4 type starter in the future.</span>

He made an immediate impact with the Razorbacks, hitting 13 homers as a freshman to help them reach the College World Series, then slammed 15 as a sophomore to bring them back to Omaha. He's one of the best athletes in the 2020 college crop and is Arkansas' toolsiest prospect since Andrew Benintendi went seventh overall in the 2015 Draft, but a poor start to the shortened 2020 season could drop him out of the first round. An explosive athlete, Martin offers an exciting combination of power and speed. He records run times that grade from 70-80 on the 20-80 scouting scale, though he's still learning how to translate that quickness into stolen bases. He has the potential to be a 25-25 player but gets overly homer-conscious and his right-handed swing gets too uphill, leading to strikeouts. If Martin can slow the game down a bit offensively and defensively, he can be a star. His quickness and solid arm strength give him the tools to play a number of positions and perhaps stay at shortstop if he becomes more consistent. He played a fine third base as a freshman and definitely would fit in center field, though he should be able to stay on the dirt.</span>

He was the Wolverines' best offensive performer in 2019, when they surprisingly finished second at the College World Series, and again this spring. One of the most physical players in this year's Draft, he offers more offensive upside than former Michigan outfielder Jordan Brewer, an Astros third-rounder last June. Nwogu packs prodigious strength in his 6-foot-3, 235-pound frame and generates impressive exit velocities, showing the ability to crush fastballs out of any part of any ballpark. He has an unorthodox but quick right-handed swing and his lower half seems out of sync with the rest of his body, but his impressive hand-eye coordination makes it work. He controls the strike zone reasonably well but still has to show he can make adjustments to handle breaking balls and changeups. Nwogu has plus speed and runs the bases aggressively. His quickness doesn't play nearly as well in the outfield, where he doesn't get good jumps and struggles going back on balls. His arm strength has improved in college but is still fringy, so he'll likely wind up in left field after playing center this spring in place of the injured Jesse Franklin.</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 75                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               DeSoto Central High (Southaven, Miss.) produced a supplemental first-round slugger in Austin Riley in 2015, and five years later has a player with even more raw power. Jordan ranked as one of the top players in the 2021 class until he reclassified last May, becoming one of the youngest (17 years, five months on the originally scheduled Draft day of June 10) and most intriguing prospects in the 2020 group. He won the High School Home Run Derby at the All-Star Game in July, though he had less success facing live pitching on the showcase circuit. Few players in the 2020 Draft can do more damage to a baseball than Jordan, whose legend began to grow when he won his first national home run derby at age 11 and belted a pair of 500-foot homers at another when he was 13. His combination of impressive strength and bat speed allows him to hit mammoth blasts without a lot of loft in his right-handed stroke, and he recorded the highest exit velocity (106.9 mph) at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship in October. He still has to answer questions about his hitting ability after a summer of swings and misses against older competition, though his proponents think he'll make enough contact once he gets more time to adjust. While Jordan has worked diligently to lose weight and improve defensively at third base, most scouts believe he's almost certainly destined to play first base as a pro. The Mississippi State recruit possesses average arm strength but he's a below-average runner whose lack of quickness is better suited for first base. Wherever he plays, he'll create most of his value with his power.</span>

While Adams didn't break out until the National High School Invitational during his senior year, Norris has been famous on the showcase circuit for a while. He has the pitches and physicality to go in the first round but won't because he hasn't been able to harness them. Norris' powerful 6-foot-4 frame already produces fastballs that sit at 90-94 mph and peak at 96 with some late life. When he's on, both his upper-70s curveball and low-80s slider grade as at least plus offerings. He's in the early stages of developing a changeup with some sink. More strong than athletic, Norris has difficulty keeping his delivery in sync and staying online to the plate. He has 107 walks in 141 career innings at Green Hope and his command is shakier than his control. He might not go high enough in the Draft to divert him from a North Carolina commitment and his long-term role could be as a reliever.</span>

Warren impressed with his hitting and on-base ability in the Mid-American Conference last season, then established himself as a quality prospect by doing the same in the Cape Cod League. He spent some time behind the plate for the Chippewas this spring, adding to his intrigue. A switch-hitter with a quick, sound swing from both sides, Warren makes line-drive contact with ease. He's more of a gap-to-gap hitter than a home run threat, though he did set a school record with 22 doubles last year. He's not afraid to work deep counts in the pursuit of walks, and plays quicker than his fringy-to-average speed thanks to aggressiveness on the bases. Warren's future defensive home is in question because his so-so range and funky arm action aren't suited for shortstop. His solid arm could help make him an asset at third base (where he played on the Cape) if he shows enough power to profile there, or he could wind up as an offensive second baseman. There are mixed reviews on him as a catcher, his high school position, though he has the hands, arm and athleticism to possibly make it work with more experience.</span>

Cade Cavalli is a lock first-rounder and Dane Acker threw a no-hitter against Louisiana State, but Prater had a better ERA (3.42) than either of them this spring. Scouts admire his perseverance and competitiveness, which helped him overcome a lawnmower accident that cost him two fingers on his non-pitching hand when he was not quite 2 years old. Prater's fastball parks around 90-91 mph and tops out at 93 with enough armside run to keep it off barrels. His slider hovers around 80 mph and is tough on left-handers because he sets up on the first-base side of the rubber and throws across his body. His changeup has similar velocity and fades well enough to keep right-handers at bay. Prater's delivery features some effort and his control is just decent, yet his pure stuff plays better than its fringy to average grades. He has managed to outpitch and miss more bats than Cavalli in each of their three seasons together with the Sooners. It's easy to say that Prater profiles more as a middle reliever, but his track record and his makeup may allow him to become a back-of-the-rotation starter.</span>

He racked up 26 saves, second in school history behind only David Berg, and was quickly becoming one of the best relief pitching options in the Draft class this spring, with a 20/2 K/BB ratio while allowing just three hits and no runs over 9 1/3 innings in eight appearances. Powell isn't one of those college relievers you wonder about whether he could start at the next level. The nation's Stopper of the Year as a sophomore, the 6-foot right-hander is bullpen only, but the type who could move quickly. He typically sits in the low 90s with his fastball and is regularly up to 96 mph. It's his slider, though, that's the real separator. It's a filthy out pitch that gets a ton of swings and misses, a plus pitch for sure. Powell does have a changeup, but it's that electric fastball-slider combination that has peaked scouts' interest. With a loud delivery, he's had trouble with command, but was finding the strike zone more consistently this spring and throws enough strikes to profile well in the back of a bullpen, a role he relishes, with the makeup to close games at the next level.</span>

But a strong performance in the PDP League led to a spot at the MLB High School All-Star Game in Cleveland and he performed well later in the summer at the Area Code Games to put him more firmly on the map. The outfielder often displays impressive tools across the board. He's a plus runner, one who led the PDP League by going a perfect 6-for-6 in stolen base attempts, and that speed allows him to cover a lot of ground in the outfield. He also has a very strong arm, one that's been up to 92 mph off the mound. He makes loud contact consistently from the left side of the plate and while he's hit over power now, he's shown the ability to drive the ball and was launching balls out at Angels Stadium this past fall during the Angels Elite showcase, the same event where 2019 first-rounder Keoni Cavaco showed up for the first time. Halpin, who initially committed to UCLA but then decided to head out of state and play at Texas should the Draft not work out, might be underestimated by some scouts. Pete Crow-Armstrong is the more famous name among California prep outfielders, but don't be surprised if Halpin isn't all that far behind him.</span>

This year's Draft offers several players who showed their ability on the gridiron as quarterbacks as well as the baseball field, starting with top 100 players like Cade Horton in Oklahoma and Nolan McLean in North Carolina. Barnhart, who was the MVP of his league as St. Joseph's QB, had his name jumping up Draft boards and moving closer to those two thanks to a quick start this spring. There were two things that jumped out in Barnhart's performances this spring that gave him some helium. The first was more velocity with his fastball, up to 96 mph at times. The other was his curve, a true plus breaking ball thrown 77-80 mph that he can really spin. His changeup is behind the other two and he hasn't thrown it much, but he throws the 81-84 mph offspeed pitch with good arm speed and it has the chance to develop into an average offering in the future. Though his inexperience as a pitcher shows at times in terms of his approach and mechanics, Barnhart throws a lot of strikes and it's easy to believe that the big, strong, athletic right-hander will have solid command in the future. There was an up arrow next to his name when things shut down and thought of him being committed to pitching only could have teams willing to take the Arizona State commit in the top five rounds.</span>

He starred as a freshman and while his numbers declined as a sophomore as he got more power-happy, he helped the Wolverines to a shocking second-place finish at the 2019 College World Series. Scouts were curious as to which version would show up in 2020, but he broke his collarbone in a skiing accident and never took the field before the shortened season ended. Franklin's strength gives him solid to plus raw power and he's at his best when he lets it come naturally. He did a better job of that in 2018 compared to last year, when he improved at controlling the strike zone but didn't make as much quality contact while his left-handed stroke got more uphill. He has hit for average but with only modest power in the wood-bat Cape Cod League, so his offensive projection remains a bit of a puzzle. Franklin also possesses solid speed but doesn't always play that fast. He hasn't shown much basestealing prowess and displays shaky reads and routes at times in center field. He has fringy arm strength, so if he can't stay up the middle he'll have to play left field.</span>

He excels at putting the bat on the ball with a flat right-handed swing and he has solid speed, but he also presents a tough profile because his approach yields little power and his defensive home is uncertain. He injured his throwing shoulder as a freshman, spent almost all of his sophomore year at DH and played left field with a below-average arm this spring. It's possible that he could play center field and he did see some action at second base in 2018.</span>

Not only could many teams' scouts check in with parent clubs during Spring Training, but there were many Sun Devils worth checking out. At the top of that list, of course, is Spencer Torkelson, but after a slow start, Hauver was starting to show his bat deserved plenty of attention on its own. After scuffling a bit as a freshman, Hauver began to show what he's capable of doing as a sophomore, hitting .339/.433/.574, largely as the Sun Devils' leadoff hitter. A move to the three-hole behind Torkelson messed him up initially, but he was starting to heat up and show once again he can drive the ball and he can draw walks from the left side of the plate. He has the chance to hit for both average and power at the next level with a solid overall approach. His bat is going to have to play because it's a bit unclear where he plays defensively. A shortstop in high school, Hauver played left field at ASU because there were better options on the dirt on the roster. He believes he can play the infield, and if that's the case, second base would be the best bet given his limited range. Some see a Daniel Murphy type in the future, one who maybe plays second, left, even some first base, with his bat carrying him up the ladder.</span>

Vogel isn't quite at that level in terms of his Draft stock, but after missing the summer showcase circuit, he was moving up boards by showing off his considerable tools before the season was shut down. Compact and strong, Vogel is one of the fastest guys in the Draft class, occasionally recording 80 run times. Most believe he's going to hit at the next level, with a really simple swing from the right side of the plate that allows him to barrel up the baseball on a consistent basis. Though he's undersized, there is some pop there, and he's shown the ability to drive the ball. His plus speed allows him to be a serious basestealing threat. Vogel's speed allows him to cover a ton of ground in center field and he has an above-average arm from the outfield as well. Because he wasn't seen over the summer, the UCLA commit's tools surprised some people earlier this spring. That could lead to him being taken in the top three rounds.</span>

His toughness translates to the mound, where he set a school record with 17 saves in 2019, including three in Omaha as the Commodores won their second national championship. He wasn't as sharp in the shortened 2020 season but still should be one of the first relievers drafted. Brown usually attacks hitters with a 91-94 mph fastball with running action that misses bats up in the strike zone, topping out at 96, and an 83-86 mph slider. Both pitches were more solid than plus this spring but have shown better in the past. He also mixes in a mid-70s curveball with more depth than power to give batters a different look, and he can throw them off balance with a decent low-80s changeup. As with his stuff, Brown's control and command were a tick down this year but he usually pounds the zone. With his four pitches, strike-throwing ability and a strong 6-foot-4 build, some scouts think he has the ingredients to start and could get the opportunity to do so in pro ball. Other evaluators believe his delivery and mentality are better suited for late-inning relief.</span>

Instead, Workman headed to his father's second collegiate home, Arizona State, where he's been a starting infielder for two-plus years and had a solid performance in the Cape Cod League last summer. The 6-foot-4 switch-hitter is big, strong and athletic. He's better from the left side of the plate, both in terms of his approach at the plate and tapping into his excellent raw power. Overall, he's power over hit and needs to cut down on his strikeouts, work more counts and take more walks to become a more well-rounded offensive player. He's a solid-to-average runner, maybe a tick better underway, and he moves better than you'd think. He plays third at ASU in deference to Alika Williams, but Workman played short on the Cape and he could get the chance to play up the middle. He has the hands and arm strength to do it, but with his frame, third base seems a more likely long-term home. Because he graduated earlier than expected, Workman will be just 20 years old come Draft time, something that should work in his favor. So should his plus makeup, which will allow him to maximize his tools at the next level.</span>

Mayo also plays the hot corner, with the kind of power potential that many teams covet. There are no questions about Mayo's raw power from the right side of the plate. He can flat-out crush the ball, using his strong 6-foot-5 frame to his advantage. The concerns crop up regarding whether he'll hit enough to get to that power on a consistent basis. There's swing and miss to his game and while he'll show the ability to drive the ball to the opposite field in batting practice, he can get very pull-happy in games. Not everyone is convinced Mayo can stick at third as well. While he does have a well above-average arm, his feet and hands are just OK, which might mean a move to first base or maybe to left field. His strong arm, power and physicality might remind some of Austin Riley and the team that tries to sign him away from his commitment to Florida will believe that's who he can become.</span>

A midweek starter as a freshman and a reliever as a sophomore, he closed out the Commodores' 2019 College World Series championship with a three-inning save against Michigan. He did a much better job of harnessing his stuff in the Cape Cod League in the summer and during fall practice, but his velocity and control regressed during the shortened 2020 season. When Eder is at his best, he can work at 92-95 mph and touch 97 with his fastball and back it up with a plus curveball. But there also are days when he'll sit closer to 90 mph and lack feel for his curve. Though he can flash a solid changeup, it's still a work in progress because he hasn't used it much in short stints with the Commodores. Eder threw all three offerings for strikes on the Cape but sometimes has trouble finding the zone and can get hit hard when his location is off. His strong 6-foot-4 frame is built for durability and helps create tough angle on his pitches. If he can maintain the consistency and command of his stuff that he showed in the summer and fall, he could be a mid-rotation starter.</span>

After his sophomore year coming out of the pen, the left-hander moved to the rotation as a junior in 2020 and raised his profile with a very solid four-start beginning to the spring. The sub-6-footer has a three-pitch mix that could give him the chance to start. He can run his fastball up to 95 mph, though as a starter his velocity backed off after a few innings to around 90-91 mph. Chamberlain throws it with good riding life, and he likes to throw it up in the zone to miss bats. His curve is close to a 12-to-6 breaking ball with good bite that can miss a lot of bats, one that was responsible for eight of his 11 K's in that CWS performance. He can mix in an average changeup as well. While Chamberlain has missed a ton of bats throughout his Beavers career, striking out 12 per nine -- a rate that spiked to 13.9 over his four starts -- he's struggled to throw strikes consistently. A team taking him in the Draft might send him out as a starter to see if he can refine his command, but there's a good chance he ends up back in the bullpen, where his fastball-curve combination would play up.</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 92                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Coming out of Palos Verdes Peninsula High School in Southern California, Frasso was a tall and gangly basketball player and pitcher with a ton of upside, but who had difficulty making the transition from one sport to the next, which kept his velocity down for much of the spring. He looked like the type of pitching prospect who needed college, and that's proven to be true. Focusing on baseball at Loyola Marymount, he's started catching up to his upside over his first two years, though an elbow injury suffered before the shutdown put his Draft stock a bit more in question. Frasso pitched mostly in relief as a sophomore so he could have more of a regular impact, and ended up saving 10 games. But he began his junior year as a starter, with the chance to work on his three-pitch mix. The velocity is now there consistently when healthy, and the 6-foot-5 right-hander is up to 97 mph with his fastball. He's lived off his four-seamer up in the zone almost entirely during his college career and it misses a ton of bats, as it has tremendous life. He has a sweeping 74-76 mph curve that can be effective at times as he tunnels it off of his fastball and shows some glimpses of an 80-82 mph changeup. Very thin with a herky jerky delivery, Frasso is athletic enough to repeat it consistently and throw a good amount of strikes, even if he's not a pinpoint command guy. Had he been able to prove he could start, he would have likely made a jump up Draft boards. The injury clouded things further, though he was reportedly throwing and working his way back when the season stopped. Pro teams could still send him out as a starter, knowing that he's very effective out of the bullpen as well.</span>

One of the better lefty sluggers in the college crop, he topped the Rebels with 15 homers last season and finished second at the College Home Run Derby.  The 6-foot-4, 240-pound Keenan is all about power, using his strength and bat speed to launch balls with topspin. There's some concern as to how well his uppercut swing will play against pro pitching, but he manages the strike zone well and uses the entire field. He makes consistent contact, getting to his pop while producing high exit velocities. A well-below-average runner, Keenan offers no value on the bases and doesn't cover much ground at third base. He has reliable hands and solid arm strength, as well as determination to stay at the hot corner, but his lack of range and ability to make throws on the run likely will land him at first base in pro ball. Former Rebel Thomas Dillard had a similar offensive profile and more athleticism when the Brewers selected him in the fifth round last year, and Keenan should go in roughly the same area.</span>

Initially headed to Wichita State, Dabovich went the junior college route and enrolled at Central Arizona when the Shockers' pitching coach left the program. The right-hander transferred to Arizona State and worked both as a starter and reliever in his first season with the Sun Devils, finishing things off with a solid performance in the Cape Cod League last summer. The 6-foot-3 hurler has largely lived off two pitches which flash plus. He has plenty of arm strength and can run his fastball up to 97 mph, sitting comfortably in the 93-94 mph range, and he's working on adding more life to it. His breaking ball has hard, three-quarters tilt to it and he'll throw it typically in the low-80s. He will work in a curve on rare occasions and he has a changeup that he wants to try to incorporate more. Pitching solely out of the bullpen before his junior season was shut down, he was proving to be very tough to hit, but also struggled with his command. His fastball-breaking ball combination does tick up in shorter stints and he has the chance to be a very effective big league reliever.</span>

No. 2 on that list, and the best lefty from the area, is MacLean, a super-projectable southpaw who entices with his ability to command his stuff as well as potential future gains in velocity and stuff. MacLean has long been known for his feel for pitching, but as a tall, skinny lefty who was throwing in the mid-80s at the Area Code Games last summer, he seemed ticketed to head to the University of Washington to become an outstanding Draft prospect three years from now. But while he didn't really get to pitch this spring, he did touch 92 mph in workouts and on video. While that doesn't automatically translate to that much velocity increase in game situations, it is a sign that he has added strength to his 6-foot-3 frame.  His fastball already played up because of his ability to command it to all quadrants of the strike zone. His low-70s curveball has some depth and his changeup gives him a third at-least future average pitch, all coming from a fluid arm action. There'd be some risk involved in terms of drafting him and signing him away form his Huskies commitment, but the ceiling might be enough to convince teams to take a chance.</span>

He then missed the 2019 season because he needed Tommy John surgery. A move to the rotation upon his return in 2020 created some serious buzz for the big right-hander, though he was only able to make four starts before the season was ended. There's a lot to like about Ragsdale, starting with his 6-foot-8 frame that allows him to throw with a good downhill plane. He features a fastball that's typically in the 91-95 mph range right now, but there's room for more velocity in the future. He couples it with a curveball that flashes plus and can be a real strikeout pitch when he lands it in the strike zone. He has a changeup, but it's a distant third pitch and will need to be developed at the next level. Ragsdale threw a lot of strikes this spring, but is still more control than command at this point. Given that scouts only saw four outings from Ragsdale as USF's Sunday starter, there's very limited track record for teams to look at, but his size and arm strength, even if it ends up in the bullpen, could be enough for teams to take a chance on him in this year's Draft.</span>

The Gators' three best arms -- right-hander Brandon Birdsell and lefties Little and Mitchell Parker -- all could fit in the first five rounds this year. Little tweaked his back after his first start in February and missed four weeks, then came back to make four relief appearances before the season ended early. Little has the highest maximum velocity of any southpaw in the 2020 Draft and created buzz when video surfaced of him hitting 105 mph in an indoor workout in May, though he tends to work at 93-96 in longer outings. He has made progress with his secondary pitches but they still need more work. His low-80s slider is his No. 2 option, and he also has come up with an upper-70s curveball and a nascent changeup. Little has gotten in much better shape this season, dropping 30 pounds from his massive 6-foot-8 frame and doing a better job of repeating his delivery in limited action, though scouts still don't care for his arm action or mechanics. He tallied 86 strikeouts versus 39 walks in 44 1/3 innings in two years at San Jacinto, and it's difficult to project him as more than a reliever who can air out his fastball in short stints. If he doesn't sign this summer, he'll pitch at South Carolina in 2021.</span>

While he did get some time as a starter as a sophomore, the southpaw likely profiles best as a reliever because of command issues. After a solid Cape Cod League showing last summer, Wu-Yelland was off to a good start to his 2020 season (0.69 ERA, 11.1 K/9 and a comparatively low 3.5 BB.9), using a fastball that touches the mid-90s, a breaking ball and a solid changeup.</span>

The next in line is Vukovich, who won't go in the first round out of high school like Lux and Kelenic but does offer some of the best high school power in the 2020 Draft. He finished second to Blaze Jordan at the High School Home Run Derby at the All-Star Game last July. Vukovich has long levers and a lot of projectable strength in his 6-foot-5 frame, which combine with the bat speed and loft in his right-handed stroke to produce well above-average raw power. His swing can get long and he employs a leg kick to help generate his pop, leading to some concerns about his ability to make consistent contact against quality pitching. He struggled at the Area Code Games in August and batted just .167 for the U.S. national team at the under-18 World Cup in September. Scouts also aren't sold that Vukovich will be able to stay at third base, where he lacks quickness but does display solid arm strength. A basketball star who averaged 27.8 points and 13.1 rebounds per game while making second-team all-state as a senior, he moves well for his size and is athletic enough to handle an outfield corner, though some evaluators project him as a first baseman. If he follows through on his commitment to Louisville, he'll be Draft-eligible as a sophomore in 2022.</span>

He was off to a slow start offensively before the season ended this spring, but there are some tools to like here. Dyer is a plus runner with an easily plus arm who shows above-average defensive skills behind the plate. He's also athletic enough to play center field and second base, pointing to a potential future career as a super-utility type. While he has added a little strength to his long and lean frame, his offensive profile is somewhat limited.</span>

He has a big league body (6-foot-5, 215 pounds) and three tools that grade as plus or better, yet he's a career .264/.379/.408 hitter for the Bearcats and slugged just .354 with wood bats in the Cape Cod League last summer. Wiemer's bat speed, strength and leverage give him plus raw power from the right side of the plate, but he's still figuring how to translate it into production. He utilizes a big leg kick and he has an uphill, max-effort swing and timing issues that lead to a lot of groundball contact. He probably will need to overhaul his stroke at the next level, though he does show some patience at the plate. Wiemer has plus speed and an aggressive nature on the bases, showing a knack for stealing bags. He has well above-average arm strength and has hit 98 mph on the mound, though a lack of control undermined him when Cincinnati briefly tried to use him as a closer this spring. He has played left field for the Bearcats, though his quickness and arm would suggest he can handle any outfield assignment.</span>

He was Iowa's top 2018 prep prospect until he graduated a semester ahead of schedule to enroll early at Missouri, which will make him one of the youngest college players (20 years, 9 months) in the 2020 Draft. After posting a 1.56 ERA as a sophomore reliever last spring, he dominated even more as a starter in the Cape Cod League (0.59 ERA, .383 opponent OPS, 36/3 K/BB ratio) and continued to pound the strike zone in that role this spring. Bedell's two- and four-seam fastballs sat in the low 90s when he started on the Cape, with sink or run depending on which version he used. He worked more in the upper 80s in cold weather during the truncated 2020 season, but his heater continued to play up because of his command. There's debate as to whether his fading low-80s changeup or his slightly slower curveball is his best secondary pitch, and he also can mix in a mid-80s cutter. Bedell has a sound delivery and the athleticism to repeat it with ease. He attacks hitters with confidence because he can locate his pitches where he wants. Fellow Missouri hurler T.J. Sikkema rode pitchability and a high floor into the supplemental first round in 2019, and Bedell could take a similar path this year.</span>

Now a broadcaster for the Angels, his son is making a name for himself as one of the better high school middle infielders in the Class of 2020. Tolentino has the chance to hit and be a big league regular shortstop. There's no question about his defensive ability, with a plus arm and the feet and actions to stick at the premium position long term. How much he'll hit will determine what kind of overall prospect he is. He's a tough out with an opposite-field approach who sees a lot of pitches and makes a lot of contact with a Johnny Damon-like swing. He does roll over balls to the pull side at times and doesn't barrel up the ball consistently enough with wood. He has added some strength to his lower half, giving some scouts hope that he'll add some extra-base authority as he matures. The UCLA recruit does make the most of his abilities with a high baseball IQ, and the team that thinks he'll impact the ball consistently will be the one to take him in the early rounds.</span>

He's displayed very little power because of a lack of premium bat speed and leverage in his swing, leading some to worry about how much he'll impact the baseball at the next level, though his home college park has a reputation for being pitching-friendly. Some scouts feel he has the chance to be a very good shortstop defensively, and he's also shown the ability to slide over and play third, though that would put more pressure on his bat.</span>

He returned to pitch 12 innings this spring, which was long enough to show that he had regained his arm speed and a fastball that can reach 95 mph. His curveball and changeup showed some promise but also some inconsistency, and he displayed better control (albeit in a small sample size) than he did as a freshman.</span>

He provided one of the highlights of the shortened college season, no-hitting Louisiana State with 11 strikeouts, though he got hit hard in two of his three other outings. He throws strikes with four generally average pitches, the best of which are a low-90s sinker and a slider/cutter.</span>

After a season pitching in the bullpen there, Way transferred to Northwest Florida Junior College. He jumped on the map with a strong showing as a reliever in the Cape Cod League last summer and then jumped into the rotation this spring, raising his profile even more. Long and lean, Way uses a three-quarters delivery to bring three pitches which have the chance to be average or better. He'll throw his fastball in the 91-95 mph range and can reach back for a tick or two more. His slider is very good when he stays on top of the low-80s breaking ball, but he can get under it at times. He doesn't use his mid-80s changeup much, but he's athletic enough to believe it will be an effective offering in the future. In the past, Way had struggled with his command, but in a starting role this spring, he was much more consistent in finding the strike zone. The team that takes him early enough to keep him from moving on to LSU will think the projectable right-hander has the chance to start long-term, knowing that the fastball-slider combination will work really well out of a bullpen.</span>

He became the Hokies' primary catcher as a Draft-eligible sophomore and was added to the 2020 Buster Posey National Collegiate Catcher of the Year Award watch list. He was off to a very hot start before the season was ended, raising his profile especially among teams who value college performers. Taylor has considerable bat speed from both sides of the plate. He's shown a good feel for the strike zone and has walked more than he's struck out in his college career. While there's a lot of raw power to tap into, Taylor gets pull-happy and out front on his swing too often to get to it consistently. He can make hard contact, but pitches on the outer third of the plate gave him trouble. While he does have an average arm behind the plate, his overall receiving skills are below average, leading to some concerns about his ability to stick there. But there could be teams interested in seeing if that will work and buying the bat, perhaps looking at a move to first base or left field, or at least splitting time among positions in the future.</span>

His hitting ability remains a question because he batted a combined .176 with a 38 percent strikeout rate in his first two seasons and put up worse numbers in the Cape Cod League last summer. He's enticing because he offers well above-average raw power from the right side of the plate, plus speed, an average arm and a chance to play center field.</span>

Scouts are divided as to whether he's a better prospect as a pitcher or an infielder, though they believe he prefers to play every day. A sore arm prevented him from pitching in midsummer showcase events but he did return to the mound and impressed in the fall. Keith makes consistent hard contact from the left side of the plate and is beginning to tap into his solid raw power, the product of bat speed and leverage. Projected strength gains should add more pop but also may slow him down enough to necessitate a move from shortstop in high school to third base in pro ball. The Arizona State recruit is an average runner whose plus arm will play on the left side of the infield. As a right-handed pitcher, Keith operates with an 89-93 mph fastball and uses his size and high three-quarters delivery to create downhill plane. His upper-70s curveball features good depth, while his changeup is more of a work in progress. His arm works well and there's plenty of projection remaining in his athletic 6-foot-3 frame.</span>

Iowa's best high school pitching prospect since Mitch Keller, he could be the state's earliest Draft pick since the Pirates made Keller a second-rounder in 2014. But he only got one disappointing outing in this spring before the coronavirus shutdown, making it unlikely a team will spend enough to lure him away from his Texas Christian commitment. Baumler has a strong, athletic frame that currently produces 90-94 mph fastballs with riding life and he projects to add more velocity in the future. His curveball lacked consistency early in the summer but improved afterward, showing good depth and leading some evaluators to grade his bender as a future plus offering. He hasn't used his changeup much but demonstrates some feel for the pitch. Scouts love Baumler's clean delivery and arm action, which should allow him to throw strikes and stay healthy. He's a quality athlete who has flashed some power and speed while playing a variety of positions, including catcher. Though he drew some college football interest after kicking and punting for Dowling Catholic's (Des Moines) 4-A state championship football team in 2018, he committed to play baseball only at TCU.</span>

He's been up-and-down for much of his Trojans career, though he did take over as the Friday night starter during his sophomore year, a role he held at the start of the 2020 season before things were shut down. Hurt has long had the size and pure stuff to make him a very strong pitching prospect. His fastball will sit in the 92-94 range and he will top out at 97 mph, and he could find more consistent velocity at the top end of that scale as he continues to add strength to his 6-foot-3 frame. His best secondary pitch is his changeup, which could be a plus pitch in time. He throws both a hard slider in the upper-80s and a slower, upper-70s curve, both of which show glimpses but are inconsistent breaking pitches. The right-hander hasn't always commanded his stuff well or maintained it deep into starts, with the sharpness of his stuff often varying from outing to outing. He entered the spring as one of the more enigmatic college pitching prospects in this class and there wasn't really enough time for scouts' questions to be completely answered this spring.</span>

He broke out in the Northwoods League last summer, reaching 99 mph during the wood-bat circuit's all-star game and finishing with a 0.86 ERA and 38 strikeouts in 21 innings. After the Panthers moved him into their rotation this spring, he continued to make progress with his breaking ball and control. As a starter in 2020, Klein worked at 92-94 mph and topped out at 96 with his four-seam fastball, which is fairly straight but does feature some riding action. He also flashed a solid curveball with power and depth. He began incorporating a changeup into his repertoire, but it lacks velocity separation from his heater and lags well behind his other two offerings. While Klein shaved his walk rate from 9.8 per nine innings in his first two college seasons to 4.8 in his truncated third, he'll need to upgrade his control and command in order to remain a starter in pro ball. He has a strong 6-foot-5 frame built for durability but probably will wind up in the bullpen. In shorter stints, he could focus on his two best pitches and his fastball might park in the upper 90s.</span>

He spent his first two years coming out of the bullpen, earning first-team All-Big West Conference honors as a sophomore. After a strong turn in relief on the Cape last summer, Dollard looked very good in his first chance as a starter for the Mustangs this spring. Tall and athletic, Dollard has the chance to have a four-pitch mix that he knows how to use well, even if none of his individual offerings jump off the page. Velocity-wise, his fastball only sits in the 88-90 mph range, topping out at around 93 mph, but it plays up because of its sink and Dollard's ability to command and manipulate it so well. His 77-80 mph slider is his out pitch and flashes plus at times, though he doesn't always throw it hard enough and he can fold in a low-70s curveball with depth as well. Dollard doesn't throw a ton of changeups, but he shows very good feel for it and it could end up being his best secondary pitch in the future. Dollard has walked just 2.2 per nine in his college career and walked only 1.3 over his four starts this spring. Some see a little Tom Eshelman in him, the Fullerton command artist who went in the second round back in 2015, though Dollard isn't expected to come off the board quite as early.</span>

He hit .360 at the 2019 College World Series as Michigan lost in the finals, its best finish since winning the 1962 national title. His makeup stands out more than any of his individual tools but he makes contact at the plate and plays in the field. Blomgren's speed and pure arm strength are just average, but his range and throwing are better than that. He has reliable hands, good instincts that help him reach grounders and a quick release and internal clock that allow him to get the ball across the diamond in plenty of time. He's capable of playing shortstop at the next level and has the skills to serve all over the infield in a utility role if needed. It remains to be seen whether Blomgren can provide enough offensive impact to profile as a big league regular. He makes consistent contact with a flat right-handed swing and his patience and knack for getting hit by pitches enhance his on-base skills. He sprays line drives to all fields but offers ordinary bat speed and little power, as evidenced by his .357 slugging percentage in college.</span>

Seminaris, who joined the Dirtbags rotation full-time as a sophomore, then pitched well on the Cape last summer and carried that over to the start of the 2020 season, should break that schneid. Seminaris is, in many ways, the prototypical pitchability lefty, one with a four-pitch mix and excellent knowledge of how to use it. While his fastball typically sits 88-90 mph, and tops out at 93 mph, it plays up because he commands it so well and there's deception in his delivery. He throws two breaking balls, with his mid-70s curve a bit better than his low-80s slider. But his best secondary offering is his plus changeup that misses bats and gets weak contact. Seminaris has always thrown a ton of strikes and was taking a step forward before the season was shut down this spring. He has a limited ceiling, but with his feel for pitching and track record, he'll be enticing as a potential back-end starting pitcher.</span>

His best weapon is a low-80s slider that shows flashes of becoming a plus offering. He also has a low-90s fastball that tops out at 94 mph, a get-me-over curveball and an effective changeup, showing enough pitches and the control to remain a starter.</span>

He had trouble throwing strikes in his first two seasons with the Fighting Irish and totaled just 27 2/3 innings as a result. He did make progress in the Cape Cod League last summer, giving some hope that he can harness his electric stuff, but he walked 13 batters in 8 1/3 innings during the shortened 2020 college season. Boyle has the best arm strength in the 2020 Draft. His fastball reached 102 mph in the Northwoods League during the summer of 2018 and hit 101 at the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament and on the Cape in 2019. He can operate in the upper 90s for several innings at a time while getting riding action on his heater. Boyle also can overpower hitters with an upper-80s slider but has yet to show much of a third pitch. His huge 6-foot-7 frame adds to his intimidation factor yet he has difficulty keeping all his long levers in sync and locating his pitches where he wants. He's a decent athlete, so there's optimism that he can continue to improve when he gets more regular innings in pro ball.</span>

A top 100 prospect on MLB Pipeline's Draft list, the son of former Minor League right-hander Bill Drohan was a two-sport standout who ended up going to Florida State rather than sign with the Phillies, who took him in the 23rd round of the Draft that June. After spending most of his sophomore year as a starter, he was establishing himself as a mainstay in the Seminoles' weekend rotation this spring. A successful high school quarterback before turning his complete focus to baseball, Drohan is still learning how to pitch, meaning there's still ceiling to reach. He'll touch 95 mph with his fastball at times and sits 92-93 consistently. He hides the ball well and that deception leads to a lot of swings and misses on the pitch. He has the chance to have an above-average curveball, with good three-quarter break to it and his changeup continues to improve. Drohan's command comes and goes, but because of his athleticsm, there's confidence from many scouts that he'll be able to repeat his delivery and throw more consistent strikes. There's still a lot to dream on here, giving the southpaw more upside than the typical college pitcher.</span>

He can touch 95 mph with his heavy sinker and back it up with a solid breaking ball, throwing strikes with both pitches as well as his average changeup. He has a strong 6-foot-4 frame, but his stuff tends to drop off after a couple of innings so he profiles better as a reliever.</span>

A 40th-round pick by the Yankees in 2017, he became an immediate starter at Louisiana-Lafayette. One of just six NCAA Division I players to total as many as 25 extra-base hits and 25 steals in 2019, he hurt his Draft stock by batting .148 during the four-week college season this spring. A switch-hitter, Cantrelle hits the ball with more authority from the left side of the plate. He has the potential to bat near the top of the batting order with his knack for drawing walks and getting on base, and he also has plus speed and knows how to use it. He has some sneaky pop with 15-homer upside, though he needs to focus less on power and more on making consistent contact. With his quickness and solid arm strength, Cantrelle is capable of playing shortstop at an average big league standard. Teams wanting better defense may prefer him at second base, where he looked good during Cape Cod League play last summer. If he doesn't make enough offensive impact to hold down a regular job, his athleticism and versatility would lend themselves to a utility role.</span>

JUCO hitters have had difficulty catching up to his 90-94 mph fastball, which features deception and downhill plane, and his mid-70s overhand curveball. His long arm action and control leave something to be desired, so he projects more as a reliever than as a starter. If he doesn't sign this summer, he'll attend Kentucky in 2021.</span>

His best pitch is his solid curveball, and he also has an 88-91 mph fastball that misses bats because of his command and deception. He throws strikes and keeps hitters off balance by mixing in a slider and changeup, making him a high-floor guy who might become a back-of-the-rotation starter.</span>

He comes at hitters with a lot of deception, hiding the ball well and using a slightly lower arm angle. He's up to 96 mph with his fastball, and his slider has progressed over his time at UCF.</span>

A reliever on the Longhorns' 2018 College World Series team as a freshman, he has served as their No. 1 starter the last two seasons. He doesn't light up radar guns but has one of the higher floors among this year's college pitchers, which could land him in the first three rounds. Elder's out pitch is a quick mid-80s slider that he'll use in any count. He has feel for manipulating the spin on his pitches, which also gives him a distinct curveball that's tight and features more downward break. His sinker sat in the low 90s more often this spring, ranging from 88-95 mph, and he also employs a changeup that can be an average offering but gets a bit firm at times. Elder provides strikes with all four pitches and they tunnel well together, allowing the sum of his repertoire to play better than its individual parts. He has a strong 6-foot-2 frame and repeats his delivery well, giving him the durability to remain in the rotation. Scouts love his mound presence, which adds to his chances of becoming a No. 4 or 5 starter.</span>

Emanuels won't enter into those kinds of conversations, but after two years as a reliever and a solid Cape Cod League performance, followed by a move to the rotation this spring, he was opening eyes before the season shut down. Long and athletic, the 6-foot-5 Emanuels has an ideal pitcher's frame, though he doesn't always take full advantage of it. He throws his low-90s fastball, one that will touch 95 mph, with a loose arm and the ball jumps out of his hand, getting on the hitter in a hurry to create a lot of late swings. That happens even though he's a bit of a short-strider with his delivery and finishes a bit upright. He'll sometimes show two distinct breaking balls, but they often blend into an average pitch that is more slider than curve. He'll mix in an average changeup as well. Emanuels tends to be around the strike zone, though he doesn't have pinpoint command. It's possible there's more in the tank velocity-wise as he adds weight and strength. A team taking him would likely send him out as a starter to see if what he showed this spring is for real, knowing that everything would tick up a bit if he ended up back in the bullpen.</span>

Rosario, who showed off his right-handed bat over last summer at events like the Area Code Games, gives the island state the chance to make it 5-for-7. All talk around Rosario centers around his bat, more specifically his plus-plus raw power. Rosario beat fellow Draft prospect Blaze Jordan in the Area Code Games home run derby last summer. He can get a little pull-happy and out front on his swing at times, and there are some concerns about his ability to hit enough to get to that raw pop consistently in games at the next level. Rosario is a decent athlete, and he does play center field in high school, but as a tick-below-average runner who is already fairly physically mature, he is likely going to be limited to a corner, with left field his likely destination. He does have the power potential to profile well in an outfield corner, and that could be enough for the California Baptist recruit to get drafted.</span>

At 6-foot-1 and 175 pounds, he's smaller than desired for a starter, but he throws strikes with three pitches: a 90-92 mph fastball that peaks at 94, a hard slider and a changeup. In shorter stints in the past, he has run his heater up to 96.</span>

Foscue has been a more consistent hitter but Westburg has a higher ceiling and more defensive value. He tied a College World Series record with seven RBI in one game in 2018 and helped the Bulldogs return to Omaha last season. Westburg has a compact right-handed swing and possesses the bat speed and strength to provide 20 or more homers on an annual basis. He lacks consistency at the plate because he has a very aggressive, pull-happy approach and sometimes struggles with pitch recognition and managing the strike zone. After he failed to make the U.S. collegiate national team last summer, he settled down nicely in the Cape Cod League and was one of the circuit's more productive hitters. Westburg has solid speed and arm strength to match, giving him a chance to stick at shortstop at the next level. He's big for the position at 6-foot-3 and if he adds more strength to his frame, he could slow down and necessitate a move to third base. With his power potential, he still could profile offensively at the hot corner.</span>

After serving the Gamecocks as a swingman as a freshman, he opened 2019 as their No. 1 starter but broke his left foot in his third outing and missed the rest of the season. He bounced back in a big way during the summer, ranking as the best pitching prospect in the Cape Cod League and looking every bit like a first-round pick. Mlodzinski sat at 92-96 mph with his fastball on the Cape and touched 99 during fall practice, and his heater also features some sink and run. He flashed a plus curveball in high school but has scrapped that for a low-80s slider with power and depth that sometimes morphs into a cutter. He also shows feel for a sinking changeup and could have three plus pitches once he's fully developed. After compiling a 5.59 ERA while battling the strike zone in his first two college seasons, Mlodzinski pounded the zone and posted a 40/4 K/BB ratio on the Cape. The redshirt sophomore has smoothed out his three-quarters delivery since high school and did a much better job of repeating his mechanics during the summer. He's athletic and his arm works well, so there's no reason he shouldn't have good control.</span>

He began his college career at Baylor as a left fielder before moving to short midway through his freshman season. He doesn't have loud tools but he contributes in all phases of the game and has one of the higher floors in the 2020 college crop, a combination that could land him in the first round. Loftin is more of a competent than flashy defender at shortstop, where his instincts help him play quicker than his pure speed. He has solid arm strength and should be able to stay at short at the next level. He offers impressive versatility -- he started games at five positions (short, second and third base, left and right field) for the U.S. collegiate national team last summer -- and would fit nicely as a utilityman if he doesn't provide enough offensive impact to be a regular. Using an efficient right-handed swing, Loftin focuses on making contact and ranked 12th in NCAA Division I with 13.8 at-bats per strikeout as a sophomore. While he does have some sneaky power, he's mostly content with hitting line drives to all fields. He has average speed out of the batter's box and isn't much of a threat to steal, though he is faster once he gets going.</span>

But the combination of an injury that kept him off the mound for most of that senior year and a strong commitment to the University of Miami forced him to slide to the 38th round in 2018. After spending his freshman year in the Hurricanes' rotation, Cecconi is one of the more intriguing Draft-eligible sophomores in the country. The 6-foot-4 right-hander has the kind of strong and durable frame scouts love to see in a pitcher, and he shows the stuff to match at times. His fastball is regularly up to 96 mph, though his velocity drops off as he goes deeper into starts. Cecconi can be up in the zone too much and gets hit, especially when his velo declines. He throws two breaking balls, with his slider the better of the two, especially when he throws it hard, up to 87 mph. Then it's like a hard cutter with late action and power to it, but he has some arm action issues with it when it's slower and he can get around it at times. He has a changeup, but it's not a real factor, and his curve is in some ways his fourth pitch. He throws strikes, but his command within the zone needs to be refined. Cecconi is a college arm with upside because of his arm strength, though there are debates on whether he's a starter or reliever long-term. He's convinced many he can maintain his stuff to start, but there is the chance he ends up in a bullpen one day, where that fastball-slider combination would play up.</span>

That was merely an appetizer, as he repeatedly reached the upper 90s this spring and touched 100. He also has one of the best bodies in the high school pitching class and could draw first-round interest, though most clubs are more comfortable with him in the second round because of his lack of track record. Lange usually pitched around 94-95 mph this spring, featuring some run and sink at lower velocities and less life at the higher end of his velocity range. He also features power with a slider that's very inconsistent and ranges from a well below-average sweeper to a plus pitch in the mid-80s with much more bite. His changeup is even more of a work in progress because he has little reason to throw it against lower-level Texas prep competition. Full of fast-twitch athleticism, Lange has added 25 pounds of muscle since last summer and also shows promise as an outfielder who flashes plus raw power and speed. The Dallas Baptist recruit has a huge ceiling but a long way to get there, because his control and command are as raw as his secondary pitches and his low arm slot with a high elbow raises red flags. His proponents think he'll be able to add polish once he gets into pro ball and benefits from better coaching.</span>

Nevertheless, Romo has a chance to go in the first round in June because he's an outstanding defender who made strides offensively on the showcase circuit last summer. He's part of a powerhouse program at The Woodlands (Texas) High that has produced five big leaguers, including Paul Goldschmidt and first-round picks Kyle Drabek and Jameson Taillon. Romo's prowess behind the plate allowed him to lock down the starting job on the U.S. 18-and-under national team for the last two years. A potential Gold Glover, he possesses soft hands, advanced receiving skills and a strong arm with a quick release. He also garners praise for his leadership ability, work ethic and baseball IQ. Scouts have fewer questions about Romo's bat after he performed well against quality pitching during the summer, though he didn't get off to a great start in 2020 before his senior season ended prematurely. A switch-hitter, he has a better swing from the left side but has improved from the right. The Louisiana State commit will provide more contact and on-base ability than power, but he can become a .260 hitter with 12-15 homers per year while running the bases better than most catchers.</span>

He immediately cracked Auburn's weekend rotation as a freshman and struck out 15 in a game as a sophomore to tie the program record shared by Tim Hudson, Casey Mize and three others. Shoulder tightness caused him to miss a start last May and limited him during the Tigers' run to their first College World Series appearance in 22 years. When he's 100 percent, Burns can work at 92-97 mph with his fastball and locate it to both sides of the plate. His breaking ball can be a plus pitch at times, combining slider velocity in the low 80s with curveball depth, but it gets slurvy at others. He hasn't had much need for his changeup, though it has some sink and shows some signs of becoming an average third pitch. Burns lacks size and while he's strong and athletic, he comes with durability concerns because of his shoulder issues as a sophomore and a history of seeing his stuff dip later in the season. Though there's no projection remaining in his 6-foot frame, his proponents see some similarities to another former Southeastern Conference star, Sonny Gray. Scouts wanted to see if he could stay healthy and maintain his stuff throughout his junior year, but the 2020 season lasted just four weeks.</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 154                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Williams attended baseball powerhouse Rancho Bernardo High School in the San Diego area, but scouts felt he needed to add strength to raise his offensive profile and that college would allow him to develop. While he was taken by the Yankees in the 32nd round in 2017, he did head on to Arizona State. After an ordinary freshman year, he took a nice step forward as a sophomore, then followed that up with a strong summer on the Cape and for Team USA. Even in high school, Williams showed the ability to control the strike zone and make consistent contact from the right side of the plate. He doesn't swing and miss much, and walked more than he struck out during his sophomore year. While power will never be a huge part of his game, he has added some strength and showed extra-base ability last year with the Sun Devils and with wood in his hands for USA Baseball. He's not a burner, but he runs better than average and he has a good first step defensively. With above-average hands, range and ability to throw on the run and from different angles, he should have no problem staying at shortstop long term. Williams reminds some in the area of Kevin Newman, the University of Arizona shortstop who went in the first round of the 2015 Draft and is now the Pirates starter at the position. Williams has the chance to also be an everyday player at the premium position at the big league level.</span>

Both project to go in the first two or three rounds of the 2020 Draft, and Nicolas helped his cause by striking out 17 in seven one-hit innings against Sacred Heart in his final start. The nephew of former NFL quarterback Todd Blackledge, he throws even harder than former Ball State teammate Drey Jameson, who went 34th overall to the Diamondbacks last June, but he's not nearly as polished. Nicolas has one of the best fastballs in college baseball, sitting in the mid-90s as a starter and reaching 100 mph in shorter stints this fall. He also can overpower hitters with a slider that resides in the mid-80s, approaches 90 and features sharp break when it's on. Both his heater and slider have high spin rates as well and are legitimate swing-and-miss offerings. Nicolas' curveball has its moments, though his use of two breaking balls sometimes causes them to blend together, while his changeup lags behind the rest of his repertoire. There's nothing glaring with his delivery and he doesn't throw with excessive effort, but he has trouble keeping his mechanics in sync. He showed little feel for throwing strikes before this spring, so his premium stuff comes with considerable risk that he'll be a reliever.</span>

He has a similar reputation as one of the top college bats for 2020, though he has been more of a steady than spectacular performer for the Tigers. He could be the first LSU position player taken in the first round since Alex Bregman went No. 2 overall in 2015. Cabrera is equipped to hit for average and power. He has a smooth left-handed swing and doesn't try to do too much at the plate, letting his bat speed and the loft in his stroke create natural pop. He commanded the strike zone well as a freshman and less so as a sophomore, when he was hampered by a right wrist injury. Though he ran a 6.6-second 60-yard dash at a Cape Cod League workout last summer, Cabrera is more of an average runner and not much of a threat to steal. A left fielder in his first two college seasons, he shifted to right field as a junior. He has the solid arm strength to handle right field at the next level.</span>

Hence thrust himself into that neighborhood when he broke out during the fall. He hit 94 mph with his fastball at the Future Stars Series in September and then kicked his heater up to 96 at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship in October. Hence lacks physicality but compensates with quick-twitch athleticism and a fast arm. His fastball sat at 93-95 mph with heavy sink during his WWBA outing and he displayed similar velocity during a brief look this spring before the high school season ended. He also shows aptitude for spinning the ball, flashing a plus slider at 76-81 mph, and demonstrates some feel for a changeup. Hence's arsenal, athleticism and ability to repeat his sound delivery give him a chance to remain a starter despite his small frame. The Arkansas recruit will be 17 on Draft day, adding to his appeal for teams that place a premium on age.</span>

Originally committed to Louisiana State, he switched to McLennan (Texas) CC so he'd be Draft-eligible again as a freshman. He threw very well early in the junior college season before his command eluded him in his final two outings in March. Phillips has a quick arm that produces 92-96 mph fastballs that peak at 98 and he already shows the ability to hold his velocity deep into games. His upper-70s curveball has good depth and shows signs of becoming a plus pitch, though he can't always land it for strikes. He'll need to refine his changeup as he faces more advanced hitters. There's still some projection remaining in Phillips' 6-foot-2 frame, so he could add more velocity. He sometimes gets hit harder than his stuff would indicate he should because there's effort in his delivery that hampers his command, and his long arm action and high three-quarters slot allow hitters to see the ball well. He's far from a finished product but comes with plenty of upside.</span>

Miller is a half-step behind some of the top high school catchers in the Class of 2020, but he has the chance to be the best one to come out of Florida since MJ Melendez was taken in the second round of the 2017 Draft by the Royals. Miller has the chance to be a good all-around catcher who is more athletic than most backstops. At the plate, he has a really good approach with strong strike-zone awareness, typically using a line-drive, up-the-middle philosophy. He's physical with some current strength and the kind of frame that should allow him to get stronger, so seeing him grow into average power isn't unreasonable, especially once he learns to leverage and loft the ball. He runs better than most catchers and is very aggressive on the basepaths. While he needs some work with receiving and blocking, he has the agility and hands to be a good defensive catcher, and he has an above-average arm. High school catchers can take a while to develop, but the team that signs Miller away from his Wake Forest commitment could get a starting big league catcher in the future.</span>

He blew out his elbow during fall practice before what would have been his first season at Texas Tech, having Tommy John surgery in December 2017 and an arthroscopic procedure seven months later. He led the Red Raiders' 2019 College World Series semifinalists with eight saves as a redshirt freshman, then really opened eyes with nearly twice as many strikeouts (33) as baserunners (18) in 21 innings in 2020. Beeter added rather than lost velocity as he worked longer stints this year, sitting at 93-96 mph and peaking at 98 with his fastball. He has a pair of power breaking balls, a wipeout curveball in the low 80s and a slider in the mid-80s that some evaluators believe is even better. He even flashes at least a solid changeup, though he doesn't turn to his fourth option very often. Employing an overhand delivery that creates deception and steep downhill plane, Beeter tunnels his pitches extremely well. Scouts can't figure out how he went from averaging 8.7 walks per nine innings as a reliever to 1.7 as a starter without any significant mechanical changes. His lack of track record is worrisome but it's hard to argue with the quality stuff and strikes he unleashed this spring.</span>
