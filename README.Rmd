`baseballr` is a package written for R focused on baseball analysis. It
includes functions for scraping various data from websites, such as
[FanGraphs.com](https://www.fangraphs.com/), [Baseball-Reference.com](https://www.baseball-reference.com/), and [baseballsavant.mlb.com](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/). It also
includes functions for calculating metrics, such as wOBA, FIP, and
team-level consistency over custom time frames.

You can read more about some of the functions and how to use them at its
[official site](https://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/) as well as this
[Hardball Times
article](https://tht.fangraphs.com/developing-the-baseballr-package-for-r/).

## Installation

You can install the CRAN version of
[**`baseballr`**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=baseballr)
with:

``` r
install.packages("baseballr")
```

You can install the released version of [**```baseballr```**](https://github.com/BillPetti/baseballr) from [GitHub](https://github.com/BillPetti/baseballr) with:

``` r
# You can install using the pacman package using the following code:
if (!requireNamespace('pacman', quietly = TRUE)){
  install.packages('pacman')
}
pacman::p_load_current_gh("BillPetti/baseballr")
```

``` r
# Alternatively, using the devtools package:
if (!requireNamespace('devtools', quietly = TRUE)){
  install.packages('devtools')
}
devtools::install_github(repo = "BillPetti/baseballr")
```

For experimental functions in development, you can install the [development branch](https://github.com/BillPetti/baseballr/tree/development_branch):

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("BillPetti/baseballr", ref = "development_branch")
```

## **Functionality**

The package consists of two main sets of functions: data acquisition and metric calculation.

For example, if you want to see the standings for a specific MLB division on a given date, you can use the `bref_standings_on_date()` function. Just pass the year, month, day, and division you want:

```{r bref_standings_on_date}
library(baseballr)
library(dplyr)
bref_standings_on_date("2015-08-01", "NL East", from = FALSE)
```

Right now the function works as far as back as 1994, which is when both leagues split into three divisions.

You can also pull data for all hitters over a specific date range. Here are the results for all hitters from August 1st through October 3rd during the 2015 season:

```{r bref_daily_batter}

data <- bref_daily_batter("2015-08-01", "2015-10-03") 
data %>%
  dplyr::glimpse()
```

In terms of metric calculation, the package allows the user to calculate the consistency of team scoring and run prevention for any year using `team_consistency()`:

```{r team_consistency}
team_consistency(2015)
```

You can also calculate wOBA per plate appearance and wOBA on contact for any set of data over any date range, provided you have the data available.

Simply pass the proper data frame to `woba_plus`:

```{r woba}
data %>%
  dplyr::filter(PA > 200) %>%
  woba_plus %>%
  dplyr::arrange(desc(wOBA)) %>%
  dplyr::select(Name, Team, season, PA, wOBA, wOBA_CON) %>%
  dplyr::glimpse()
```

You can also generate these wOBA-based stats, as well as FIP, for pitchers using the `fip_plus()` function:

```{r bref_daily_pitcher}
bref_daily_pitcher("2015-04-05", "2015-04-30") %>% 
  fip_plus() %>% 
  dplyr::select(season, Name, IP, ERA, SO, uBB, HBP, HR, FIP, wOBA_against, wOBA_CON_against) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(IP)) %>% 
  head(10)
```
